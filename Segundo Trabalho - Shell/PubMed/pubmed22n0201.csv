16029824<Simple medium for the selective isolation of Bacteroides and related organisms, and their occurrence in sewage.<A medium composed of 0.009% sodium azide, 0.07% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.0007% ethyl violet in Brain Heart Infusion Agar (Difco) and a process of incubation in an atmosphere of 90% N(2) and 10% CO(2) for the selective isolation of certain members of the intestinal bacteroides are described. The medium appears to select predominantly members of the genus Bacteroides and a few of the genus Sphaerophorus. A survey of the occurrence of these organisms in sewage and various stages of sewage treatment indicates that they survive complete sewage treatment in low numbers and that their rate of decline parallels that of the coliforms. Large numbers were recovered from sludge digestion tanks, suggesting a possible role in the anaerobic breakdown of organic matter.<Bacteroides, isolation &amp; purification, metabolism, Culture Media, Sewage
16029825<Method for determining antineuraminidase activity.<A test was developed to screen drugs for antineuraminidase (influenza sialidase) activity in vitro. Neuraminidase prepared from Vibrio cholerae was added to a substrate containing ganglioside, prepared from calf brain. Sialic acid is a split product in the reaction. The presence of sialic acid was detected colorimetrically by use of Warren's Thiobarbituric Acid Assay after drugs had been added to inhibit the action of neuraminidase on the calf brain substrate.<Antiviral Agents, pharmacology, Chlorides, pharmacology, Chromates, pharmacology, Colorimetry, Enzymes, pharmacology, Ferricyanides, Gangliosides, metabolism, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, In Vitro Techniques, Iron, pharmacology, Neuraminidase, metabolism, Potassium Permanganate, pharmacology, Vibrio, enzymology
16029826<Use of formalinized Mycoplasma gallisepticum antigens and chicken erythrocytes in hemagglutination and hemagglutination-inhibition studies.<Antigens were prepared from Mycoplasma gallisepticum in the logarithmic phase of growth and were treated with 2, 5, and 10% Formalin by slow diffusion through a dialysis sac. Chicken erythrocytes were similarly treated with 20% Formalin. Formalin-treated antigens hemagglutinated fresh and formalinized chicken erythrocytes. The antigens retained this hemagglutinating ability over an extended period.<Animals, Antigens, Erythrocytes, drug effects, Formaldehyde, pharmacology, Hemagglutination Inhibition Tests, Hemagglutination Tests, Mycoplasma, immunology, Poultry
16029827<Recovery patterns of spores of putrefactive anaerobe 3679 in various subculture media after heat treatment.<A comparative study was made of the heat resistance of spores of putrefactive anaerobe 3679 grown in two different sporulation media and of the recovery pattern of these spores in several subculturing media after treatment with moist and dry heat. The heat resistance of the spores was characterized in the form of D and z values. The D values were determined by the modified Schmidt method. The z values were established by the graphic method. The results revealed significant differences in D and z values, depending on the type of heat and sporulation and subculture media. Spores grown in beef heart infusion showed higher heat resistance than those grown in Trypticase. Among the seven subculture media used, the largest number of spores was recovered in beef infusion. The magnitude of the D values at 121.1 C obtained with spores heated in moist heat decreased, depending on the subculture medium used, in the following order: beef infusion, pea infusion, yeast extract, liver infusion, Eugonbroth, Trypticase, synthetic medium. With spores subjected to dry heat, D values at 148.9 C decreased with the subculture medium in the following order: beef infusion, yeast extract, pea infusion and liver infusion, Trypticase, Eugonbroth, synthetic medium. The z values obtained with spores subjected to dry heat were approximately double those obtained with moist heat. Their relative magnitude varied slightly, depending on the type of subculture medium used. However, the relative magnitudes of the D values and z values with reference to the subculture media used were different with moist heat from those obtained with dry heat. Two theories are discussed as possible explanations for the logarithmic order of death of bacterial spores. The results obtained in these experiments, together with the findings of other workers, are most compatible with the theory that heat treatment of spores results in an increased rate of random injury to the genetic material of the spores.<Bacteria, growth &amp; development, Culture Media, Hot Temperature, Spores
16029828<Steroid transformations by species of Cephalosporium and other fungi.<A total of 58 cultures, tentatively identified as species of the genus Cephalosporium, were screened in flask fermentations for their ability to effect conversions of progesterone (Delta(4)-pregnene-3,20-dione) and Reichstein's Substance S (Delta(4)-pregnene-17alpha,21-diol-3,20-dione). A large number of transformations were observed by means of a series of five paper chromatography systems rated for analysis of steroid compounds ranging in polarity from progesterone to polyhydroxylated steroids. Five different transformation products were selected for isolation and identification. For purposes of recovery, conversions were conducted under submerged conditions in either 4- or 200-liter fermentors in which the broth was agitated and aerated. The steroid substrate was dissolved in acetone and added aseptically to the growing culture in a final concentration of 0.025%. After the conversions were effected, the whole broth was extracted with chloroform, and the transformation products were recovered, either by direct crystallization from solvents or through the use of silica gel columns. It was determined that C. ciferrii 21C converted progesterone to Delta(4)-androstene-3,17-dione. Kendall's Compound F (Delta(4)-pregnene-11beta,17alpha,21-triol-3,20-dione) was converted to its 20beta-ol analogue by Geotrichum sp. 51C (during these studies, a number of cultures were taxonomically reclassified). Cephalosporium sp. 27C formed the Delta(1)-analogue of Reichstein's Substance S, and Cephalosporium sclerotigenum 31C and Verticillium aphidum both converted Substance S to the 6beta-hydroxy derivative. Paecilomyces persicinus 22C converted Substance S to a product believed to be a dihydroxylated derivative.<Ascomycota, metabolism, Basidiomycota, metabolism, Cephalosporins, metabolism, Chromatography, Paper, Fermentation, Fungi, metabolism, Progesterone, metabolism, Spectrum Analysis, Sterols, metabolism
16029829<Isolation and purification of staphylococcal lipase.<An extracellular lipase was isolated from the cell-free supernatant fluid of a 24-hr culture of Staphylococcus aureus grown in Trypticase Soy Broth at 37 C with continuous agitation. The purification was achieved by precipitation with alcohol followed by differential precipitation at pH 8.6 and 4.3. Subsequent purification with Sephadex G 200 and BioGel 300 yielded a preparation which showed a 350- to 450-fold increase in specific activity over the original cell-free supernatant fluid. The purified lipase was homogeneous over a BioGel 300 column and showed a single peak on electrophoresis in a Veronal buffer (pH 8.6, Gamma/2 = 0.1). The electrophoretic mobility was -7.78 x 10(-5) cm(2) per v per sec.<Centrifugation, Chromatography, Lipase, analysis, Staphylococcus, enzymology, Ultracentrifugation
16029830<Permeability of oral tissues to blood-borne coxsackievirus B-1.<The ability of coxsackievirus B-1 to pass the barriers of the circulatory system into whole saliva has been shown previously. In this investigation, the major salivary glands and the oral mucosa were studied, and their role as participants in the excretion of coxsackievirus B-1 during viremia was evaluated. The effect of the salivary-gland stimulant pilocarpine nitrate on both the salivary flow rate and the recovery of virus during viremia was determined. A comparison was made between the amount of virus recovered from whole saliva during viremia in animals deficient in one or both of the major salivary-gland pairs and animals with a complete complement of salivary glands. The salivary glands in other animals were cannulated, and pure glandular secretions were collected during viremia and assayed for the presence of virus The amount of virus passing from the capillaries of the oral mucosa to the surface was also determined to evaluate this route as a possible site for the excretion of virus into saliva during viremia. The major salivary glands did not excrete appreciable quantities of virus during viremia. The submaxillary-gland secretions did not contain virus, and the parotid-gland secretions showed virus only at extremely high blood virus levels. Either removal of the major salivary glands or decreased salivary flow rates increased the concentration of virus in whole saliva. This observation suggested that the production of saliva by the major salivary glands tends to dilute the virus in the oral cavity. A 0.88-cm(2) sample of the oral mucosa excreted significantly large amounts of virus during viremia and suggested that the passage of virus through the oral mucosa was the major route for the excretion of virus into saliva during viremia.<Animals, Enterovirus, isolation &amp; purification, Female, Mouth Mucosa, physiology, Permeability, Pilocarpine, pharmacology, Rabbits, Saliva, microbiology, Salivary Glands, physiology, Salivation, drug effects
16029831<Effect of herbicides on cellulose decomposition by Sporocytophaga myxococcoides.<The effects of 14 herbicides on cellulose decomposition by Sporocytophaga myxococcoides were studied by growing the organism in two different liquid cellulose-mineral salts media in the presence of the test agent and then quantitatively determining the residual cellulose. In the first medium, containing acid-hydrolyzed cellulose, anthrone reagent was used to determine residual carbohydrate. In the second medium, Gooch Pyrex fritted-glass crucibles were used to determine the amount of residual Whatman powdered cellulose. The herbicides used were Atrazine, Simazine, Dacthal, Diuron, Amiben, Banvel-D, Banvel-T,2,3,6-TBA, Dicryl, Maleic Hydrazide, Stam F-34, Zytron, Fenac, and Dalapon. Of these, Zytron appeared to be the most inhibitory to the test bacterium, and was the only compound exhibiting inhibition at a commonly used field rate of application (2 ppm).<Bacteria, drug effects, metabolism, Carbohydrates, analysis, Cellulose, metabolism, Herbicides, pharmacology, Soil Microbiology
16029832<Assessment of virucidal ability of chemical disinfectants.<Increasing interest has been shown in studying and testing the virucidal properties of disinfectants. At the moment there are no well-established standard methods available; quite different procedures have been employed. Therefore, there is no satisfactory way of comparing the results obtained in this field. We present some of these problems and propose standard test methods to overcome these difficulties.<Antiviral Agents, pharmacology, Disinfectants, pharmacology, Viruses, drug effects
16029833<Dose response curve linearization and computer potency calculation of turbidimetric microbiological vitamin assays.<The dose response curves of various turbidimetric microbiological assays, including vitamin B(12), Ca pantothenate, and pyridoxine (vitamin B(6)), were linear with logarithmic transformation of the responses by use of the equation derived, ln[T(x) - T(infinity)] = ln A - Bx. A Fortran computer program which used the slope ratio potency calculation was written. The assay potencies calculated by the computer program showed excellent agreement with those obtained by the manual calculation.<Biological Assay, Computers, Pantothenic Acid, analysis, Pyridoxine, analysis, Vitamin B 12, analysis, Vitamins, administration &amp; dosage
16029834<Comparative effects of chlortetracycline, freezing, and gamma radiation on microbial population of ocean perch.<The microbial populations in chlortetracycline (CTC)-treated (50, 100, 200, and 500 ppm), frozen (-15 C), and irradiated (0.1 Mrad) ocean perch (Sebastodes alutus) were compared. The control sample spoiled at 7 C, primarily because of the growth of Pseudomonas. Irradiation changed this to Achromobacter-dominated spoilage. Freezing or CTC treatment altered the spoilage pattern very little. CTC was particularly effective against ultraviolet fluorescent Pseudomonas species at the higher concentrations. Freezing and CTC were not effective against "coryneforms."<Alcaligenes, isolation &amp; purification, Animals, Bacillus, isolation &amp; purification, Bacteria, isolation &amp; purification, Chlortetracycline, pharmacology, Corynebacterium, isolation &amp; purification, Fishes, drug effects, radiation effects, Flavobacterium, isolation &amp; purification, Food Preservation, Freezing, Lactobacillus, isolation &amp; purification, Marine Biology, Micrococcus, isolation &amp; purification, Pseudomonas, isolation &amp; purification, Radiation Effects, Yeasts, isolation &amp; purification
16029835<Organic acid production by Basidiomycetes. 3. Cultural conditions for L-malic acid production.<Cultural conditions were examined for the purpose of increasing yields of l-malic acid by the Basidiomycetes Schizophyllum commune and Merulius tremellosus, which have the ability to produce this acid as a main product in CaCO(3)-containing medium in shaken culture. The most favorable nitrogen sources selected were 0.3% (NH(4))(2)SO(4) and 0.18% NH(4)Cl. Effective combinations of inorganic salts in the medium were 0.1% KH(2)PO(4), 0.05% MgSO(4).7H(2)O, and 0.05% KCl, and suitable concentrations of glucose were 5 to 10%. Several nonionic surface-active agents promoted the filamentous mycelial growth of these strains and increased acid production. In particular, Tween 80 in 0.3% concentration markedly stimulated malic acid production by S. commune, and yields greater than 50% based on available glucose, were obtained after 10 to 14 days. Acid production by M. tremellosus was stimulated most with 0.5% Carbowax 4000 (polyethylene glycol), and the resultant yields were more than 40%.<Basidiomycota, drug effects, metabolism, Culture Media, Glucose, pharmacology, Malates, metabolism, Nitrates, pharmacology, Peptones, pharmacology, Quaternary Ammonium Compounds, pharmacology, Urea, pharmacology
16029836<Identification of microorganisms isolated from jet fuel systems.<Seventy-two samples from jet aircraft fuel systems were examined for microbial contamination. Ten contaminated samples yielded 43 microorganisms which were classified into nine genera of bacteria and three genera of fungi. The predominant types, comprising about 37% of the isolated cultures, were identified as Bacillus spp. The remaining cultures were distributed among 11 genera, each of which represented 2 to 9% of the total isolates. Four cultures could not be assigned to a genus on the basis of the diagnostic criteria used. Only five isolates, in the genera Pseudomonas and Hormodendrum (Cladosporium), grew abundantly in a mineral salts solution with JP-4 fuel as the sole source of carbon. The presence of fuel utilizers in a fuel system may be a better index to potential problems that have been correlated with microbial contamination than the presence of aerobic sporeforming bacilli.<Aviation, Bacillus, isolation &amp; purification, Bacteria, isolation &amp; purification, metabolism, Fossil Fuels, Fungi, isolation &amp; purification, metabolism, Petroleum
16029837<Morphological and biochemical characteristics of Aeromonas punctata (hydrophila, liquefaciens) isolated from human sources.<The isolation of Aeromonas punctata (hydrophila, liquefaciens) from feces, throat, and sputum cultures is presented as further evidence that aeromonads are found in man. Morphological and biochemical studies of these strains indicate that the chief differences between the aeromonads and physiologically similar members of the Enterobacteriaceae are found in the polar arrangement of the flagella and in the production of oxidase by the former. The oxidase test should be performed on all paracolon-like bacteria, and a flagella stain should be employed when an oxidase-positive, gram-negative bacillus is isolated. Application of these tests will undoubtedly result in more frequent identification of Aeromonas species from human sources.<Aeromonas, cytology, drug effects, metabolism, Anti-Bacterial Agents, pharmacology, Feces, microbiology, Humans, Pharynx, microbiology, Sputum, microbiology
16029838<Absorption of group A streptococcus anti-M typing sera with broken cells.<Group A streptococcus anti-M typing sera that cannot be made specific by absorption with whole streptococcus cells have been absorbed with the soluble and insoluble fractions of ruptured heterologous cells. The technique has been used successfully for preparing specific anti-M sera against eight serotypes of group A streptococcus. The method involves breakage of the absorbing cells in the presence of the antiserum, and incubation of the mixture at 37 C for 1 hr, followed by 3 to 5 days of incubation at 4 C. The procedure is useful for preparing specific antiserum from certain lots of unabsorbed antiserum that otherwise would have to be discarded because of undesirable cross-reactivity.<Immune Sera, Precipitin Tests, Streptococcus, immunology
16029839<Release of inorganic phosphate from irradiated yeast: radiation biodosimetry and evaluation of radioprotective compounds.<When cells of bakers' yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, were irradiated with ionizing radiation, inorganic phosphate, ninhydrin-reactive material, and substances absorbing at 260 mmu were released into the suspending medium. The amount of inorganic phosphate released depended on the radiation dose and on the temperature and pH during irradiation. The concentration of yeast cells did not affect the phosphate yield per milligram of yeast. It is suggested that the release of phosphate may serve as an index of the total radiation environment (i.e., as a biodosimeter) where radiation inactivation of microrganisms is of primary importance, e.g., in radiation preservation of foods. The somewhat limited range of the yeast biodosimeter (ca. 0.5 to 1.75 Mrad) may be extended by use of other more resistant microorganisms, such as bacterial spores. Compounds which have been reported as protecting microorganisms and mammals against the lethal effect of ionizing radiation also inhibited the radiation-induced release of inorganic phosphate from yeast. This phosphate release system is proposed as the basis for an economical, rapid supplement to screening procedures in the evaluation of radioprotective compounds.<Colorimetry, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Phosphates, metabolism, Radiation Effects, Radiation-Protective Agents, pharmacology, Radiometry, Saccharomyces, metabolism, radiation effects, Spectrophotometry, Temperature
16029840<Aflatoxins: production of the toxins in vitro in relation to temperature.<The production or accumulation of aflatoxins in vitro by four isolates on three substrates (acid-delinted cottonseed, shelled Spanish peanut, and rough rice) was studied in relation to temperature in the range of 10 to 40 C. Within the first 10 days after inoculation, the optimal temperature range for aflatoxin production was between 20 and 35 C. Only small amounts of the toxins were produced at 10 and 40 C. Within the optimal temperature range, the time required for toxin production and for significant accumulation decreased as the temperature increased. More aflatoxin G was produced or accumulated in relation to aflatoxin B at low temperatures (within the optimal range), and the G aflatoxins were metabolized more rapidly at the higher temperatures.<Aflatoxins, metabolism, Aspergillus, metabolism, Chromatography, Thin Layer, In Vitro Techniques, Temperature
16030094<New reflected-light microscope for viewing unstained brain and ganglion cells.<We have designed and constructed a new type of reflected-light microscope to form images including only light reflected near the plane of the object. This selectivity of image formation is based on a mechanical flying-spot technique. Objects difficult or impossible to see with earlier microscopes, such as unstained cells and cell processes in brains of living salamanders and in excised dorsal root ganglia of frogs, have been observed routinely with this microscope.<Animals, Anura, Brain, cytology, Ganglia, cytology, Ganglia, Spinal, cytology, In Vitro Techniques, Microscopy, instrumentation, Neurons, cytology
16030271<Divergent effects of actinomycin d on cortisol and on glucose stimulation of glycogenesis in mouse liver.<1. The administration of cortisol and of other glucocorticoid steroids to starved mice produced an increase in liver glycogen content, an elevation of glycogen-synthetase activity and a predominantly particulate localization of both phosphorylase and glycogen-synthetase enzymes. 2. Three daily doses of actinomycin D caused a marked glycogen depletion, a significant decrease in glycogen-synthetase activity, the solubilization of phosphorylase and glycogen synthetase and the following effects on the activities of various other enzymes: a decrease in UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase and phosphoglucomutase, an increase in glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and no change in glucose 6-phosphatase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase and UDP-glucose dehydrogenase. 3. Glucose ingestion, but not cortisol administration, reversed the effects of actinomycin D on liver glycogen content and on the activities of phosphorylase and glycogen synthetase.<Animals, Dactinomycin, pharmacology, Glucose, pharmacology, Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase, metabolism, Glucosyltransferases, metabolism, Hydrocortisone, pharmacology, In Vitro Techniques, Liver, enzymology, Liver Glycogen, biosynthesis, Male, Mice, Nucleotidyltransferases, metabolism, Phosphoglucomutase, metabolism
16030273<The occurrence of a trypsin inhibitor in brain.<1. The tryptic hydrolysis of benzoyl-dl-argininyl-beta-naphthylamide is inhibited by homogenates of human and ox brain. 2. The inhibitor is associated primarily with the membranous portion of the particulate matter, and is not found in the 90000g supernatant fraction. 3. The reaction of the inhibitor with trypsin is rapid. 4. The inhibitor is heat-stable.<Animals, Arginine, Brain, cytology, Cattle, Cell Nucleus, Humans, In Vitro Techniques, Microsomes, Mitochondria, Naphthalenes, Trypsin Inhibitors, analysis
16030274<The metabolism of 2-chloro-1-(2',4'-dichlorophenyl)vinyl diethyl phosphate (Chlorfenvinphos) in the dog and rat.<1. A single oral dose of [(14)C]Chlorfenvinphos to rats is quantitatively eliminated in 4 days. Rats do not show a sex difference in the elimination pattern and show only a small degree of biological variation in the total excretion data. Of the label 87.2% is excreted in the urine (67.5% in the first day after dosage), 11.2% in the faeces and 1.4% in the expired gases; less than 0.9% of (14)C is present in the gut and contents after 4 days. 2. After oral administration of [(14)C]Chlorfenvinphos to dogs, 94.0% (91.8-97.6%) of the (14)C is excreted in the urine and faeces during 4 days. Dogs do not show a sex difference in the pattern of elimination, and excretion of radioactivity in the urine is very rapid: 86.0% of (14)C during 0-24hr. 3. Chlorfenvinphos is completely metabolized in rats and dogs: unchanged Chlorfenvinphos is absent from the urine and from the carcass, when elimination is complete. In rats, 2-chloro-1-(2',4'-dichlorophenyl)vinyl ethyl hydrogen phosphate accounts for 32.3% of a dose of Chlorfenvinphos, [1-(2',4'-dichlorophenyl)ethyl beta-d-glucopyranosid]uronic acid for 41.0%, 2,4-dichloromandelic acid for 7.0%, 2,4-dichlorophenylethanediol glucuronide for 2.6% and 2,4-dichlorohippuric acid for 4.3%; in dogs, 2-chloro-1-(2',4'-dichlorophenyl)vinyl ethyl hydrogen phosphate accounts for 69.6%, [1-(2',4'-dichlorophenyl)ethyl beta-d-glucopyranosid] uronic acid for 3.6%, 2,4-dichloromandelic acid for 13.4% and 2,4-dichlorophenylethanediol glucuronide for 2.7%. 4. Dogs and rats show a species difference in the rate of excretion of (14)C in the urine, and in the proportions of the metabolites, with the exception of 2,4-dichlorophenylethanediol glucuronide, that are excreted in the urine. Alternative explanations for the latter species difference are suggested. 5. 2-Chloro-1-(2',4'-dichlorophenyl)vinyl ethyl hydrogen phosphate and 2,4-dichlorophenacyl chloride probably lie on the main metabolic pathway of Chlorfenvinphos, since, in common with that insecticide, they give rise to [1-(2',4'-dichlorophenyl)ethyl beta-d-glucopyranosid]uronic acid and 2,4-dichloromandelic acid as major metabolites in the urine. 6. The proposed scheme for the metabolism of Chlorfenvinphos represents a detoxication mechanism.<Animals, Biotransformation, Carbon Isotopes, Chromatography, Paper, Chromatography, Thin Layer, Feces, Female, Glucuronates, urine, Insecticides, metabolism, Male, Mandelic Acids, urine, Phosphates, metabolism, Rats
16030275<Synthesis and turnover of collagen precursors in rabbit skin.<1. The rate of synthesis of [(14)C]hydroxyproline by rabbit skin was studied in vitro and in vivo. 2. The soluble collagen fractions were shown to have a very rapid turnover. The 0.15m-sodium chloride-extractable collagen showed t((1/2)) values of 1.2hr. in vitro and 12hr. in vivo. The 0.5m-sodium chloride-extractable collagen exhibited a t((1/2)) value of 20hr. in vivo. 3. Under the conditions used it was not possible to obtain radioactive insoluble collagen in vitro. 4. A significant amount of soluble collagen is lost before it becomes insoluble. 5. These observations may help to explain why large amounts of peptide-bound hydroxyproline appear in the urine during periods of rapid collagen synthesis.<Animals, Carbon Isotopes, Collagen, biosynthesis, Hydroxyproline, biosynthesis, In Vitro Techniques, Male, Proline, metabolism, Rabbits, Skin, metabolism, Sodium Chloride
16030276<The separation of the alpha-chains of collagen by free-flow electrophoresis.<1. The separation of the alpha-components of codfish-skin and calf-skin collagen from the higher-molecular-weight components was accomplished by gel filtration with Bio-Gel P-300 resin in 5m-lithium chloride and at pH7.4. 2. From this fraction three distinct alpha-components, corresponding to the alpha1-, alpha2- and alpha3- chains of collagen, were isolated by free-flow electrophoresis in 6m-urea at 4 degrees . At the temperatures and pH values used there was no detectable degradation of the alpha-chains.<Animals, Cattle, Chromatography, Chromatography, Gel, Collagen, analysis, Electrophoresis, Fishes, In Vitro Techniques, Methylcellulose, Peptides, analysis, Skin
16030277<Mechanism of conversion of aspartate into glutamate in cerebral-cortex slices.<1. When slices of guinea-pig cerebral-cortex slices are incubated with [U-(14)C]-aspartate and non-radioactive glucose as substrates, the specific radioactivities of the citric acid-cycle intermediates are lower than that of the glutamate isolated from the same vessels. 2. Glutamate was significantly labelled when [1-(14)C]-aspartate and glucose were present in the incubation medium. These results would not be expected on the basis of simple conversion of aspartate into glutamate through the citric acid cycle, since the C-1 position of oxaloacetate is decarboxylated in the conversion of isocitrate into alpha-oxoglutarate. 3. It appears that aspartate is converted into glutamate by citric acid-cycle mechanisms; however, the carbon ;skeleton' is not immediately condensed with acetyl-CoA to form citrate but first follows the cycle in a reverse direction to fumarate or succinate and then proceeds in the forward direction. 4. The conversion of aspartate into glutamate appears to be compartmentalized.<Animals, Aspartic Acid, metabolism, Carbon Isotopes, Cerebral Cortex, metabolism, Chromatography, Gas, Citric Acid Cycle, Fumarates, metabolism, Glucose, metabolism, Glutamates, biosynthesis, Guinea Pigs, In Vitro Techniques, Ketoglutaric Acids, metabolism, Succinates, metabolism
16030278<Studies on ethionine-induced fatty liver.<1. The effects of the administration of dl-ethionine on some aspects of lipid and nucleotide metabolism in rat liver were studied. 2. In ethionine-treated animals neutral fat was increased, whereas phospholipids and cholesterol were unchanged. Lipogenesis in vitro was inhibited. 3. The concentration of nicotinamide nucleotides, purine nucleotides and pyrimidine nucleotides was decreased. The decrease was due to free adenine nucleotides, inosine nucleotides, uridine nucleotides and cytidine nucleotides. Also, the protein-bound biotin content was lower. 4. In biotin-deficient rats the development of ethionine-induced fatty liver was inhibited. 5. The possibility was considered that ethionine might produce an inhibition of the synthesis of biotin-dependent acetyl-CoA carboxylase.<Acetates, metabolism, Adenine Nucleotides, analysis, Animals, Biotin, Carbon Isotopes, Cholesterol, analysis, Cytosine Nucleotides, analysis, Ethionine, Fatty Liver, chemically induced, metabolism, Female, Guanine Nucleotides, analysis, In Vitro Techniques, Lipids, analysis, Liver, analysis, Nucleotides, analysis, Phospholipids, analysis, Rats, Uracil Nucleotides, analysis, Vitamin B Deficiency
16030279<Characterization of the ribonucleic acid synthesized by isolated rat-liver nuclei.<1. Isolated rat-liver nuclei incorporated [(14)C]UMP into RNA when incubated in the presence of Mg(2+) and all four ribonucleoside triphosphates. The addition of bentonite to the system diminished the breakdown of the newly synthesized RNA. 2. AMP and CMP were incorporated in the absence of the other added triphosphates, and in the presence of deoxyribonuclease. 3. RNA synthesized in the presence of Mg(2+) contained a high proportion of CMP and GMP, and sedimented in the regions of ribosomal RNA and of heavier molecules. About 1% of this RNA hybridized with homologous DNA, and hybrid formation was more effectively inhibited by nuclear RNA than by ribosomal RNA. 4. RNA synthesized in the presence of Mn(2+) plus ammonium sulphate had a composition intermediate between that of ribosomal RNA and of DNA, and about 4% of this RNA formed hybrids with DNA. 5. Less than 2% of the newly synthesized RNA was capable of forming ribonuclease- and deoxyribonuclease-resistant complexes. 6. It was concluded that the newly synthesized RNA arose as a result of an asymmetric process and included both ribosomal and DNA-like species.<Adenine Nucleotides, metabolism, Animals, Carbon Isotopes, Cell Nucleus, metabolism, Centrifugation, Density Gradient, Cytosine Nucleotides, metabolism, DNA, Deoxyribonucleases, In Vitro Techniques, Liver, cytology, metabolism, Magnesium, RNA, biosynthesis, Rats, Ribosomes, Uracil Nucleotides, metabolism
16030280<Gluconeogenesis in the kidney and liver slices of a lizard, Uromastix hardwickii.<1. The liver and kidney of the lizard Uromastix hardwickii have much higher contents of carbohydrate than have been reported for the corresponding rat tissues. Most of this carbohydrate still remains in the tissue even after a long preincubation. 2. Kidney slices of this lizard release both glucose and other carbohydrates into the medium. Hence glucose release alone, as demonstrated for rats, cannot be used as a good criterion of gluconeogenesis in this lizard. Moreover, the results obtained by glucose release did not agree with those in which the total carbohydrate was estimated in the slice and medium. 3. l-Glutamate, l-aspartate, dl-valine, l-proline, l-cysteine, l-lactate and succinate stimulated gluconeogenesis in the kidney slices, whereas citrate, l-alanine, l-serine, glycine, l-arginine and l-leucine did not. In liver slices only l-glutamate increased gluconeogenesis. 4. New carbohydrate formation in the kidney and liver slices after incubation with various substrates indicated that gluconeogenesis as well as the amino acid metabolism in this animal may be somewhat different from that of mammals.<Animals, Aspartic Acid, pharmacology, Cysteine, pharmacology, Desert Climate, Gluconeogenesis, drug effects, Glutamates, pharmacology, In Vitro Techniques, Kidney, metabolism, Lactates, pharmacology, Liver, metabolism, Proline, pharmacology, Reptiles, Succinates, pharmacology, Valine, pharmacology
16030281<Pectic polysaccharides of growing plant tissues.<1. The polysaccharide compositions of the cell walls of sycamore cambium and sycamore callus tissue have been analysed and found to be directly comparable. 2. Electrophoretic analyses of the whole pectins prepared from actively growing callus and cambial tissue have shown that these preparations contain, in addition to the neutral and weakly acidic components present in apple fruit, a strongly acidic polygalacturonic acid component. 3. The weakly acidic component of all the pectins was directly comparable with that of the pectinic acid of apple fruit. 4. The components of the whole pectin of sycamore callus tissue have been partially purified and analysed. The neutral and weakly acidic components also found in apple fruit were isolated. 5. The pattern of the composition of the neutral sugars present in the pectins of actively growing tissues of cambium and callus has been compared with those present in apple-fruit pectinic acid. 6. The presence of rhamnose linked as galacturonosyl-(1--&gt;2)-rhamnose has been found in sycamore whole pectin. 7. The difference in the pectins of callus, cambium and fruit appears not to be that of species difference but is more characteristic of the nature of the growth and growth conditions of the cells.

Purified phospholipase D can catalyse the transfer of a ;phosphatidyl' unit from lecithin to various aliphatic alcohols such as glycerol, ethanolamine, methanol and ethylene glycol with the formation of the equivalent phospholipid. 2. The transferase reaction occurs simultaneously with hydrolase activity but at high alcohol concentrations the former predominates. 3. The acceptor molecule must contain a primary alcoholic grouping. 4. The chromatographic and ionophoretic mobilities of the deacylation products of many enzymically synthesized phospholipids are reported. 5. Enzymically prepared phosphatidylglycerol has been isolated in good yield. Chemical degradation showed that the ;phosphatidyl unit' of lecithin had been transferred predominantly to the alpha-hydroxyl groups of glycerol. 6. Water-soluble alcohols can markedly stimulate the liberation of choline from ultrasonically treated lecithin by phospholipase D. The stimulation is usually due to an increase in hydrolase activity although often the associated transferase activity contributes.<Alcohols, metabolism, Chemical Phenomena, Chemistry, Chromatography, Thin Layer, Glycerol, Phosphatidylcholines, metabolism, Phospholipases, metabolism, Phospholipids, biosynthesis, Transferases, metabolism
16030284<The reaction of sulphite ions with an intermolecular disulphide bond in bovine serum non-mercaptalbumin.<1. The reaction of SO(3) (2-) ions with bovine serum non-mercaptalbumin was studied at physiological pH. 2. The presence of an intermolecular disulphide bond between the protein and one of two small molecules is confirmed. 3. The bonds are readily cleaved according to the equation:AlbS.SR+SO(3) (2-) right harpoon over left harpoon AlbS.SO(3) (-)+RS(-)but the additional presence of 2m-urea is necessary to separate the small molecules from the protein. 4. The points of elution of the small molecules from a column of Sephadex G-25 correspond to those of glutathione and cysteine.<Chemical Phenomena, Chemistry, Chloromercuribenzoates, Chromatography, Gel, Cysteine, Dialysis, Glutathione, Serum Albumin, Bovine, Sulfhydryl Compounds, Sulfites, Urea
16030285<The action of cabbage-leaf phospholipase D upon lysolecithin.<1. The action of the water-soluble phospholipase D from Savoy cabbage leaves upon an aqueous solution of lysolecithin has been studied. 2. Optimum conditions required the presence of Ca(2+) ions and pH5.8. 3. Equivalence was found between the amounts of lysolecithin hydrolysed and free choline released. The reaction was not accompanied by deacylation. 4. As the enzymic degradation proceeded, an opalescence developed, owing to the insolubility of the reaction product in the presence of Ca(2+) ions. 5. Evidence has been obtained indicating the heterogeneity of this reaction product.<Calcium, Chemical Phenomena, Chemistry, Chromatography, Thin Layer, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, In Vitro Techniques, Lysophosphatidylcholines, metabolism, Phospholipases, metabolism, Plants, Edible, enzymology
16030286<Determination of 14C-labelled ketone bodies by liquid-scintillation counting.<1. A method of assaying (14)C in ketone bodies present in blood by using liquid-scintillation counting is described. 2. d(-)-beta-Hydroxy[(14)C]butyrate is converted quantitatively into [(14)C]acetoacetate by means of a coupled oxidoreduction reaction involving NAD(+), d(-)-beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase and malic dehydrogenase in the presence of a high concentration of oxaloacetate. 3. [(14)C]Acetoacetate is decarboxylated to acetone and carbon dioxide which are trapped separately in a double-well flask and counted subsequently. 4. The method permits the determination of (14)C activity in the individual ketone bodies and allows the activity in the carboxyl carbon atoms of acetoacetate or of d(-)-beta-hydroxybutyrate to be assayed separately from the activity in the remainder of the molecule. 5. Recoveries of (14)C-labelled ketone bodies added to blood approach 100% with good reproducibility in replicate analyses.<Acetoacetates, blood, Acetone, Carbon Dioxide, Carbon Isotopes, Hydroxybutyrate Dehydrogenase, Hydroxybutyrates, blood, Ketone Bodies, blood, Malate Dehydrogenase, Radiometry
16030287<Studies on the endogenous metabolism and senescence of starved Sarcina lutea.<1. When washed suspensions of Sarcina lutea are starved aerobically in phosphate buffer at the growth temperature of 37 degrees , the rate of endogenous oxygen consumption decreases to very low values after 10hr., although many of the cells survive for 40hr. If starvation is prolonged further, the bacteria die at a rate of approximately 1.5% of the initial viable population per hour. 2. Oxidation of intracellular free amino acids accounts for most of the observed endogenous oxygen uptake but RNA is also utilized and a portion of the component bases and pentose is degraded and presumably oxidized. Ammonia appears in the supernatant and some pentose and ultraviolet-absorbing nucleotide are released from the cells. DNA, protein and polysaccharide are not measurably degraded. 3. Survival can be correlated with the ability of aerobically starved bacteria to oxidize exogenous l-glutamate and glucose. When starved under nitrogen for 40hr. cells continue to oxidize their endogenous reserves at undiminished rates when transferred to aerobic conditions; on prolonging anaerobic starvation the rate of oxidation declines during the period of most rapid loss of viability. 4. In the presence of Mg(2+), RNA degradation during aerobic starvation is almost completely suppressed without affecting the period for which the bacteria survive. 5. Cells grown in peptone supplemented with glucose accumulate reserves of polysaccharide which are metabolized in aerobic starvation, together with free amino acids. Ammonia is evolved and RNA is degraded to a greater extent than in peptone-grown suspensions. Bacteria rich in polysaccharide survive less well than those which are deficient in the polymer; the reason for this phenomenon has yet to be established. 6. In peptone medium, endogenous oxygen uptake and the concentration of intracellular free amino acids decline as growth progresses and they continue to decrease when the organism is held in stationary phase. Under the conditions used, the endogenous Q(o2) and free amino acid pool of cells grown in peptone with 2% (w/v) glucose did not decline so markedly and the bacteria contained large amounts of polysaccharide at all stages of growth.<Aging, Glucose, metabolism, Glutamates, metabolism, Magnesium, Oxygen Consumption, Peptones, metabolism, Polysaccharides, metabolism, RNA, Bacterial, metabolism, Sarcina, metabolism, Succinates, metabolism
16030288<The characterization of the whey proteins of guinea-pig milk. The isolation and properties of alpha-lactalbumin.<1. The whey proteins of guinea-pig milk were examined by electrophoresis on paper, cellulose acetate, starch gel and polyacrylamide gel. 2. Two major proteins were detected, one of which was identified as blood serum albumin. 3. The major whey protein was isolated by CM-cellulose chromatography and on columns of Sephadex G-100. 4. The amino acid composition of the protein, taken in conjunction with its other properties, indicated that the major whey protein in guinea-pig milk is homologous with cow alpha-lactalbumin and that beta-lactoglobulin is absent from guinea-pig milk. 5. Guinea-pig alpha-lactalbumin, which was obtained crystalline, had mol.wt. 15800, N-terminal lysine and C-terminal glutamine.<Albumins, analysis, Amino Acid Sequence, Amino Acids, analysis, Animals, Chromatography, Gel, Chromatography, Ion Exchange, Electrophoresis, Glutamine, Guinea Pigs, In Vitro Techniques, Lysine, Milk, analysis, Molecular Weight
16030289<The oxidation of D-quinate and related acids by Acetomonas oxydans.<1. Growing cells of a small number of strains of Acetomonas oxydans oxidized d-quinate to 5-dehydroquinate. 2. d-Shikimate was oxidized to 4,5-dihydroxy-3-oxocyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxylate (3-dehydroshikimate, formerly 5-dehydroshikimate). 3. d-Dihydroshikimate was oxidized to the corresponding 5-dehydro compound, but epidihydroshikimate oxidation by growing cells was not observed. 4. Cell-free extracts oxidized d-quinate to 5-dehydroquinate with the consumption of the stoicheiometric amount of oxygen, but oxidation of shikimate and dihydroshikimate did not go to completion. 5. Oxidation of quinate was brought about by a constitutive particulate enzyme probably localized in the cytoplasmic membrane. No evidence was found for the participation of NAD, NADP or free flavine compounds in electron transport, but the system was cytochrome-linked.<Acetobacter, metabolism, Alcohol Oxidoreductases, metabolism, Chromatography, Paper, Cinchona, metabolism, Cycloparaffins, metabolism, Manometry, Oxidoreductases, metabolism, Plants, Medicinal, Quinic Acid, metabolism, Shikimic Acid, metabolism, Spectrophotometry
16030290<A study of the sulphur amino acids of rat tissues.<1. In a study of the metabolism of l-[(35)S]methionine in vivo, the labelled sulphur compounds of rat liver and brain were separated first by ion-exchange chromatography into two fractions containing (i) free sulphur amino acids such as methionine, cystathionine, cyst(e)ine and homocyst(e)ine and (ii) glutathione. 2. Two-dimensional paper chromatography with butan-1-ol-acetic acid or propionic acid-water in the first direction and 80% acetone or acetone-ethyl methyl ketone-water in the second direction was found superior to other solvent systems for separating the sulphur amino acids. 3. At 10min. after injection of [(35)S]methionine only a small part of the (35)S was found combined in free methionine or other free sulphur amino acids. 4. Evidence was obtained of the presence of adenosyl[(35)S]methionine and adenosyl[(35)S]homocysteine in perchloric acid extracts of rat liver and brain. 5. The trans-sulphuration pathway was active in brain as well as in liver.<Amino Acids, analysis, Animals, Animals, Newborn, Brain, metabolism, Brain Chemistry, Chromatography, Ion Exchange, Chromatography, Paper, Cysteine, analysis, Glutathione, analysis, Homocysteine, analysis, In Vitro Techniques, Liver, analysis, metabolism, Male, Methionine, analysis, metabolism, Rats, Sulfur Isotopes
16030291<The effect of illumination of the malic acid content and anion/cation balance of mustard leaves (Sinapis alba).<1. Mustard plants have been grown under conditions in which the length of artificial day could be controlled. 2. Leaf samples were analysed for malic acid and citric acid, and for a number of inorganic anions and cations. A simple method is described by which sap was obtained from 0.5g. samples of leaves. 3. In days of 16hr. or more, malic acid was accumulated; the chief cation accumulated was calcium. 4. When the day-length was reduced the malic acid content decreased considerably but the calcium content remained the same. There was little change in the pH value of the sap, the balance of anions and cations having been maintained mainly by increases in citrate and nitrate contents. Analyses of the whole leaf still showed some deficiency in anion after sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, nitrate, sulphate, inorganic phosphate, chloride, malate and citrate had been accounted for. 5. Analyses at shorter intervals revealed a large diurnal variation in malic acid content, which increased during the first 5-6hr. of the light period, and fell during darkness. 6. The significance of these findings is discussed, and it is suggested that malic acid accumulation is a by-product of photosynthesis, calcium being taken up irreversibly to maintain anion/cation balance, and hence creating a continuing need for anions to balance it.<Calcium, analysis, Chlorides, analysis, Citrates, analysis, In Vitro Techniques, Light, Magnesium, analysis, Malates, analysis, Mustard Plant, metabolism, radiation effects, Nitrates, analysis, Phosphates, analysis, Plants, Medicinal, Potassium, analysis, Radiation Effects, Sodium, analysis, Sulfates, analysis
16030292<The characterization of ficaprenol-10, -11 and 12 from the leaves of Ficus elastica (decorative rubber plant).<Evidence from mass, nuclear-magnetic-resonance and infrared spectrometry and from gas-liquid and thin-layer chromatography is presented in favour of the presence of cis-trans-decaprenol, -undecaprenol and -dodecaprenol in the mixture of polyprenols (2.6mg./g.) isolated from leaf tissue of Ficus elastica. The trivial names ficaprenol-10, -11 and -12 are proposed. Nuclear-magnetic-resonance studies showed that each of these prenols contains three trans internal isoprene residues and a cis ;OH-terminal' isoprene residue. Ficaprenol-11 is the major component of the mixture. Chromatographic evidence suggests the presence also of small amounts of ficaprenol-9 and -13. The precise position of the three trans internal isoprene residues was not determined but it is suggested that these are adjacent to the omega-terminal isoprene residue and that the ficaprenols are formed from all-trans-geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. It is also suggested that ficaprenol-10, -11, -12 and -13 are probably the same compounds as castaprenol-10, -11, -12 and -13.<Alcohols, analysis, Chromatography, Gas, Chromatography, Thin Layer, In Vitro Techniques, Infrared Rays, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Rubber, Spectrum Analysis, Terpenes, analysis
16030293<The metabolism of di-(3,5-di-tert.-butyl-4-hydroxybenzyl) ether (Ionox 201) in the rat.<1. Up to one-third of a single oral dose of Ionox 201 was absorbed in rats. 2. In rats dosed with [(14)C]Ionox 201 86.8-97.2% of the label is excreted in the faeces in 24 days (much of this is eliminated in the first 4 days after dosage), 5.6% in the urine and not more than 0.8% in the exhaled air; 5.0% of (14)C is present in the carcass and viscera after removal of the gut, and most of this is in the fatty tissues. 3. About 65.0% of (14)C in the faeces is due to unchanged antioxidant, 30.0% to 3,5-di-tert.-butyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid, 3.5% to unidentified polar constituent(s), 1.4% to 3,5-di-tert.-butyl-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde and 0.1% to 3,3',5,5'-tetra-tert.-butyl-4-,4'-stilbenequinone. A variable proportion of (14)C in the urine is due to 3,5-di-tert.-butyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid (40-60%) and the remainder (60-40%) to the ester glucuronide, when the animals were treated with different doses of antioxidant. In eight individual animals dosed with 6.78mg. of [(14)C]Ionox 201, one-third of (14)C in the bile is due to the free acid, 45% to the ester glucuronide, 20% to an unidentified constituent and 2% to unchanged antioxidant, and, in two animals dosed with 13.56mg., there is a small proportion of free acid and a larger proportion of ester glucuronide. About 80% of (14)C in the body fat is due to unchanged antioxidant, 19% to the free acid and 1% to 3,5-di-tert.-butyl-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde. 4. At least 36.2% of a single oral dose of Ionox 201 is metabolized: 3,5-di-tert.-butyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid accounts for 30.2% of a dose, (3,5-di-tert.-butyl-4-hydroxybenzoyl beta-d-glucopyranosid)uronic acid for 1.4%, 3,5-di-tert.-butyl-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde for 1.3%, 3,3',5,5'-tetra-tert.-butyl-4,4'-stilbenequinone for 0.1% and unidentified polar metabolite(s) for 3.2%. 5.

The sialic acid content of fresh and fixed Ehrlich ascites cells was determined by incubation with neuraminidase and analysis of the supernatants. 2. The content of sialic acid was also determined on ultrasonically disrupted cells either with or without prior neuraminidase treatment, and the location of sialic acid in the cell is discussed. 3. The sialic acids, cleaved from cells by neuraminidase, were identified chromatographically. 4. Proteolytic enzymes were used to isolate from cells a mucopeptide containing sialic acid and galactosamine in almost equimolar proportions. 5. The nature of the carbohydrate-amino acid bond in the muco-peptide was investigated by alkaline hydrolysis. 6.

16030296<The incorporation of long-chain fatty acids into phospholipids of respiring slices of rat cerebrum.<1. Respiring slices of adult rat cerebrum have been shown to incorporate long-chain (14)C-labelled fatty acids into phospholipid. 2. Labelling was almost entirely confined to lecithin and ethanolamine phospholipid, only traces being present in serine phospholipid. 3. Palmitic acid, oleic acid and linoleic acid were incorporated more actively into lecithin than into ethanolamine phospholipid, but the converse was found with stearic acid. 4. All four acids labelled the 1- and 2-positions of both lipids; palmitic acid, oleic acid and linoleic acid were approximately evenly distributed, but stearic acid was incorporated predominantly at the 1-position. 5. It is considered that incorporation is most likely brought about through acylation of endogenously derived lysophosphatides. 6. The possible implications of this pathway of lipid metabolism in nervous tissue are discussed.<Animals, Brain, metabolism, Carbon Isotopes, Chromatography, Thin Layer, In Vitro Techniques, Linoleic Acids, metabolism, Oleic Acids, metabolism, Oxygen Consumption, Palmitic Acids, metabolism, Phospholipids, biosynthesis, Rats, Stearic Acids, metabolism
16030298<The effect of temperature and anoxia of rat-kidney slices on their subsequent respiration.<1. Rat-kidney slices were kept, aerobically and anaerobically, at 4 degrees , 20 degrees and 38 degrees , for 0.5-24hr. The oxygen consumption was then measured at 38 degrees . 2. After 6hr. of storage at 4 degrees the rate of oxygen consumption was the same as controls, but after 12 and 24hr. of storage the oxygen consumption fell by 22 and 32% respectively; there was no difference between the slices kept aerobically and anaerobically for periods of 2-24hr. at 4 degrees . 3. Anaerobic storage at 20 degrees for 2hr. did not affect the subsequent rate of oxygen consumption, but after 4 and 6hr. the anaerobically stored tissue showed loss of oxygen consumption. Aerobic storage had no effect for 6hr. 4. There was a marked fall in the capacity to consume oxygen after 0.5hr. at 38 degrees without oxygen. 5. Kidney slices stored at 4 degrees lost nitrogen. The presence of oxygen did not affect this nitrogen loss.<Animals, In Vitro Techniques, Kidney, metabolism, Male, Oxygen, pharmacology, Oxygen Consumption, drug effects, Rats, Temperature
16030299<Association of inorganic-pyrophosphatase activity with human alkaline-phosphatase preparations.<1. The inorganic-pyrophosphatase activity of alkaline phosphatases prepared from human liver and small intestine was investigated at different stages of purification. 2. Both liver and intestinal preparations possessed pyrophosphatase activity at all stages of purification, and the two types of activity were not separated by gel filtration or by anion-exchange or cation-exchange chromatography. 3. After starch-gel electrophoresis of the tissue extracts, the zones of pyrophosphatase activity coincided exactly with alkaline-phosphatase zones. 4. Hydrolysis of each type of substrate was inhibited by the presence of the other, and a constant ratio of alkaline-phosphatase activity to pyrophosphatase activity was maintained during inactivation of the enzymes by incubation at 55 degrees . 5. These results are consistent with the view that alkaline phosphatases are also inorganic pyrophosphatases.<Alkaline Phosphatase, metabolism, Chromatography, Gel, Chromatography, Ion Exchange, Electrophoresis, Humans, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, In Vitro Techniques, Intestine, Small, enzymology, Liver, enzymology, Pyrophosphatases, metabolism
16030300<Effect of glucose load and of insulin on the metabolism of glucose and of palmitate in sheep.<1. Simultaneous measurements of the entry rates of palmitate and glucose have been made in Merino sheep (wethers), starved for 24hr., by using constant infusions of [9,10-(3)H(2)]palmitate and [U-(14)C]glucose. 2. The infusion of glucose into the peripheral circulation of the sheep lowered the endogenous entry of both glucose and palmitate. Since palmitate is roughly metabolically representative of the free fatty acid fraction, there was no marked change in the calories available to the sheep. 3. The infusion of insulin into either the peripheral or portal circulation increased the uptake of glucose and decreased the uptake of palmitate by the tissues of the sheep. 4. The infusion of insulin into the peripheral circulation produced a depression in glucose entry after about 80min., whereas the infusion of insulin into the portal circulation produced an almost immediate depression in glucose entry. 5. The hypoglycaemia produced gave rise to an increase in free fatty acid production followed by an increase in glucose production. 6. No direct effect of insulin on the metabolism of free fatty acids has been demonstrated by the techniques used. The effect of insulin on the metabolism of free fatty acids is apparently mediated through its effect on glucose metabolism.<Animals, Carbon Isotopes, Fatty Acids, Nonesterified, metabolism, Glucose, metabolism, pharmacology, Insulin, pharmacology, Jugular Veins, Palmitic Acids, metabolism, Portal System, Sheep, Tritium
16030303<Some properties of purified phospholipase D and especially the effect of amphipathic substances.<1. The soluble phospholipase D of cabbage was purified by heat treatment, acetone precipitation and electrophoresis on a density gradient of aqueous glycerol. 2. The purified enzyme slowly attacked a lecithin suspension whereas ultrasonically treated lecithin was hydrolysed more rapidly. 3. Diethyl ether stimulated the hydrolysis of both the lecithin suspension and ultrasonically treated lecithin. 4. Ca(2+) was essential for the hydrolysis (optimum about 0.04m); it could not be replaced by Mg(2+) or cationic amphipathic substances. 5. The reaction had a sharp pH optimum at pH5.4, irrespective of the physical form of the lecithin substrate or the activator used. 6. Anionic amphipathic substances such as dodecyl sulphate, phosphatidic acid, triphosphoinositide and monocetyl phosphoric acid, were potent activators of the reaction: other acidic lipids were relatively inactive. 7. Cationic amphipathic substances inhibited the hydrolysis; however, they also reversed the inhibition caused by using an excess of anionic amphipathic substance as activator. 8. The activation produced by amphipathic substances could not be correlated with their effect on the zeta-potential or size of the substrate particles. 9. The addition of activating anionic amphipaths to lecithin induces the latter to adsorb enzyme from solution. In the absence of Ca(2+) the enzyme is denatured on the highly negatively charged surface, but in the presence of Ca(2+) (or Mg(2+)) it is protected from denaturation. It is suggested that this adsorption is an essential prerequisite for ready enzymic hydrolysis. 10. The hydrolysis of lecithin by the enzyme was strongly inhibited by protamine sulphate (0.1mg./ml.) and by choline and ethanolamine. 11. Ultrasonically treated phosphatidylethanolamine, or mixed particles of phosphatidylethanolamine plus dodecyl sulphate, were slowly attacked by the enzyme provided that Ca(2+) was present.<Calcium Chloride, Chemical Phenomena, Chemistry, Electrophoresis, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Phosphatidylcholines, Phosphatidylethanolamines, Phospholipases, Plants, Edible, enzymology, Surface-Active Agents, Ultrasonics
16030302<The action of aflatoxin B1 on the rat liver.<The administration of a single dose of aflatoxin B(1) to the rat (7mg./kg. body wt.) results in the slow development of a periportal necrosis. Hepatic enzymes are released into the serum in the second 24hr. of the poisoning, closely preceding the onset of the necrosis, which is followed by a rise in serum alkaline-phosphatase activity and bilirubin concentration. Aflatoxin B(1) has been detected in the nucleus of the poisoned liver cell and in vitro it has been shown to interact with DNA. The toxin inhibits the production of nuclear RNA, probably by preventing the transcription of DNA by the RNA polymerase. It is proposed that the interaction of the toxin with DNA gives rise to its inhibitory action on mitosis and its necrogenic action.<Aflatoxins, toxicity, Animals, Carbon Isotopes, Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury, metabolism, DNA, metabolism, Glutamate Dehydrogenase, metabolism, In Vitro Techniques, Isocitrate Dehydrogenase, metabolism, Leucine, metabolism, Liver, drug effects, enzymology, Malate Dehydrogenase, metabolism, Male, Necrosis, Orotic Acid, metabolism, Phosphates, metabolism, Phospholipids, biosynthesis, Protein Biosynthesis, RNA, biosynthesis, Rats
16030305<A method for the degradation of radioactive nicotinic acid.<A chemical degradation scheme is reported, which permits the measurement of the radioactivity of each carbon atom of nicotinic acid. Nicotinic acid is decarboxylated by heating with copper chromite to give carbon dioxide (C-7) and pyridine. The pyridine is converted into 4-nitropyridine 1-oxide, which is heated with aqueous calcium hypobromite to give tribromonitromethane. Combustion of the latter gives carbon dioxide derived from C-4 of the nicotinic acid. Nicotinic acid is also reduced to nipecotic acid, which is oxidized to succinic acid by acidic potassium permanganate. Stepwise degradation of the succinic acid by standard procedures gives two samples of carbon dioxide, which correspond to C-3, C-6 and C-4, C-5 of the nicotinic acid. Benzoylation of the nipecotic acid, followed by oxidation with permanganate at pH7, gives 5-amino-4-carboxyvaleric acid; this is converted into 2-methyleneglutaric acid by the action of nitrous acid. Hydrogenation of the 2-methyleneglutaric acid over rhodium in methanol gives 2-methylglutaric acid, which is oxidized with dilute chromic acid to acetic acid. Stepwise degradation of the acetic acid by standard procedures gives two samples of carbon dioxide, which correspond to C-2 and C-3 of the nicotinic acid. Thus the radioactivities of C-2, C-3, C-4 and C-7 are determined directly and those of C-5 and C-6 by difference. The method was shown to be isotopically valid for [2,3,7-(14)C]-, [4,6-(14)C(2)]- and [5-(14)C]-nicotinic acid.<Carbon Dioxide, Carbon Isotopes, Chemical Phenomena, Chemistry, Glutarates, Infrared Rays, Nicotinic Acids, Piperidines, Potassium Permanganate, Pyridines, Spectrophotometry
16030306<Microbial growth on C1 compounds. Uptake of [14C]formaldehyde and [14C]formate by methane-grown Pseudomonas methanica and determination of the hexose labelling pattern after brief incubation with [14C]methanol.<1. A study has been made of the incorporation of carbon from [(14)C]formaldehyde and [(14)C]formate by cultures of Pseudomonas methanica growing on methane. 2. The distribution of radioactivity within the non-volatile constituents of the ethanol-soluble fractions of the cells, after incubation with labelled compounds for periods of up to 1min., has been analysed by chromatography and radioautography. 3. Radioactivity was fixed from [(14)C]formaldehyde mainly into the phosphates of the sugars, glucose, fructose, sedoheptulose and allulose. 4. Very little radioactivity was fixed from [(14)C]formate; after 1min. the only products identified were serine and malate. 5. The distribution of radioactivity within the carbon skeleton of glucose, obtained from short-term incubations with [(14)C]methanol of Pseudomonas methanica growing on methane, has been investigated. At the earliest time of sampling over 70% of the radioactivity was located in C-1; as the time increased the radioactivity spread throughout the molecule. 6. The results have been interpreted in terms of a variant of the pentose phosphate cycle, involving the condensation of formaldehyde with C-1 of ribose 5-phosphate to give allulose phosphate.<Carbon Isotopes, Formaldehyde, metabolism, Formates, metabolism, Fructose, Glucose, metabolism, Heptoses, Hexosephosphates, biosynthesis, Leuconostoc, metabolism, Methane, metabolism, Methanol, metabolism, Pentosephosphates, biosynthesis, Phosphates, biosynthesis, Pseudomonas, metabolism
16030507<Variations in small and large vessel volumes caused by cations, adrenaline and histamine.<1. Plasma and blood cell volumes were measured simultaneously with [(131)I]albumin and [(32)P]erythrocytes, together with the arterial haematocrits, in acutely splenectomized dogs anaesthetized with sodium barbital. These measurements were made during control runs and after the administration of vasoactive substances.2. With these data and previously derived equations the mean composite radius of all small vessels with a radius &lt; 150 mu, the distribution of the blood volumes between small and large vessels, and other variables could be calculated.3. Adrenaline, CaCl(2) or vasopressin administration caused a reduction of the mean composite radius, a net shift of erythrocytes and plasma out of the small vessel volume, and an expansion of the large vessel volume. Histamine, KCl and MgCl(2) produced opposite effects.4. Adrenaline appeared to cause the release of sequestered erythrocytes into the active circulation.5. The effects of CaCl(2) and KCl persisted for several hours, while those of MgCl(2) did not.6. The effects of vasopressin could be reversed by histamine, those of adrenaline by splenic plasma or KCl, and those of CaCl(2) by MgCl(2).7. It was suggested that the observed vasoactions are essentially the resultants of diverse combinations of direct and indirect actions on the capacitance section of the small vessel volume.<Animals, Blood Vessels, drug effects, Blood Volume, drug effects, Blood Volume Determination, Calcium Chloride, pharmacology, Dogs, Epinephrine, pharmacology, Erythrocytes, Hematocrit, Histamine, pharmacology, Magnesium, pharmacology, Phosphorus Isotopes, Potassium Chloride, pharmacology, Serum Albumin, Radio-Iodinated, Spleen, physiology, Vasomotor System, drug effects, Vasopressins, pharmacology
16030509<The significance of adenosine cyclic 3',5'-monophosphate for the contraction of smooth muscle.<1. The influence of adenosine cyclic 3',5'-monophosphate (3',5'-AMP) and of drugs believed to increase or decrease its concentration in the tissues has been determined on the response of vascular and uterine smooth muscles to catecholamines. Generally, drugs believed to increase tissue content of 3',5'-AMP potentiated the responses and those believed to decrease it depressed them.2. The cardiovascular responses of dogs (with major vessels occluded in the chest) to carotid occlusion were potentiated by infusions of theophylline and sodium fluoride. Infusion of theophylline also potentiated the response of the occluded abdominal vessels to noradrenaline.3. Intravenous infusions of theophylline and sodium fluoride potentiated pressor responses to catecholamines in the pithed rat. Infusions of iminazole depressed the responses in two animals and was without effect in two others.4. In spinal cats intravenous infusions of theophylline potentiated pressor responses to catecholamines, but sodium fluoride was without effect.5. Contractions of the isolated rat aortic strip to noradrenaline were always potentiated by sodium fluoride and by theophylline, and depressed by iminazole, when they were recorded isometrically. Theophylline always potentiated the contractions, when they were recorded isotonically but sodium fluoride was mostly, and iminazole always, ineffective.6. 3',5'-AMP in concentrations from 0.1 to 20 mug/ml. potentiated the responses of the isolated rat aortic strip to noradrenaline in thirty-eight experiments out of hundred. Concentrations from 10 to 500 mug/ml. sometimes depressed contractions recorded isometrically. In five experiments, exposure to low concentrations for 3 hr increased the resting tension of the preparation.7. Responses to noradrenaline of uteri from oestradiol-treated rabbits were potentiated by vasopressin and by sodium fluoride, but not by theophylline or iminazole. In progesterone-treated animals the responses were unaffected by vasopressin and sodium fluoride, but potentiated by theophylline and depressed by iminazole. 3',5'-AMP was without effect on the uterine responses.8. It is concluded that the results support the view that an increase in the tissue content of 3',5'-AMP potentiates the contraction of vascular and uterine smooth muscle in response to catecholamine. This view is supported by the observation that the nucleotide itself can potentiate the responses of the rat aortic strip to noradrenaline.<Adenine Nucleotides, pharmacology, Animals, Aorta, drug effects, Blood Vessels, drug effects, Cats, Decerebrate State, physiopathology, Dogs, Electrophysiology, Epinephrine, pharmacology, Female, Fluorides, pharmacology, Male, Muscle Contraction, drug effects, Muscle, Smooth, drug effects, Norepinephrine, pharmacology, Rabbits, Rats, Theophylline, pharmacology, Uterus, drug effects, Vasopressins, pharmacology
16030511<The experimental production of watery vacuolation in the acinar cells of the submandibular gland.<1. Watery vacuolation in the acinar cells of the rat submandibular gland is described. The vacuoles are cytoplasmic, membrane-walled, and 2-20 mu in diameter. They are visible in living cells and appear to contain a watery fluid.2. Vacuolation occurred regularly in the following experimental situations: (1) in vitro-under anoxic conditions (2) post mortem-in animals killed by anoxia, and (3) in vivo-during secretion.3. By in vitro experiments it was shown that vacuolation occurs only when the cells are both anoxic and exposed to an excess of extracellular fluid containing calcium and bicarbonate. It was further shown that vacuolation is reversible in oxygen and that both its development and recovery are temperature dependent.4. Evidence is presented that the vacuolation is not a degenerative or necrotic change, that it is accompanied by the entry of fluid into the cells, and that it is not caused by simple osmosis.5. The mechanism of vacuolation and its possible relation to secretion are discussed. It is suggested that vacuolation represents an imbalance between the ingestion and secretion of water and salts.6. Similar vacuoles, apparently produced by the same mechanism, were observed in the acinar cells of the parotid gland and the pancreas of the rat.7. The close similarity of this vacuolation to that previously described in rat liver cells was noted.<Animals, Culture Techniques, Cytoplasm, physiology, Hypoxia, Male, Rats, Submandibular Gland, cytology, physiology
16030513<Further studies on intestinal active transport during semistarvation.<1. The effect of semistarvation (sufficient to produce a loss of 18-28% of initial body weight) on the active transport of D-glucose and L-histidine by the rat, the guinea-pig and the golden hamster has been investigated by the use of sacs of everted small intestine (from upper jejunum to lower ileum).2. In the rat and the guinea-pig the dietary restriction resulted in increased active transport in all regions of the small intestine. In contrast, it caused no alteration in active transport in the hamster.3. The response in the rat was most impressive in the middle-to-lower ileum during D-glucose uptake. Whereas normal sacs from this area appeared unable to move the sugar against its concentration gradient, sacs from semistarved rats did so quite well.4. Although there was a considerable loss (24-29%) of intestinal dry weight in all three species when the food intake was reduced, shortening of the small intestine was not detectable in the guinea-pig or the hamster and was present to only a minor extent in the rat.5. Evidence is presented indicating that the enhanced active transport is not merely a reflexion of the thinning of the intestinal wall and that it occurs during complete as well as in partial starvation.<Animals, Biological Transport, Active, Body Weight, Cricetinae, Glucose, metabolism, Glycine, metabolism, Guinea Pigs, Histidine, metabolism, In Vitro Techniques, Intestine, Small, physiology, Male, Rats, Starvation, physiopathology
16030514<Release of noradrenaline by splenic nerve stimulation and its dependence on calcium.<1. Cat spleens were perfused with Krebs bicarbonate solution using a constant flow pump. The amount of noradrenaline released during splenic nerve stimulation was measured at various frequencies. The dependence of noradrenaline release on the ionic composition of perfusion medium was also determined.2. The effect of frequency of stimulation on the output of noradrenaline was studied in both normal and phenoxybenzamine treated cats. In normal cats, the output was 0.33 ng/stimulus at 10/sec, whereas it was 1.21 ng/stimulus at 30/sec. In phenoxybenzamine-treated cats, the maximum output of noradrenaline of 4 ng/stimulus was obtained at 5 or 10/sec. Higher or lower frequencies of stimulation produced lower output.3. In both normal and phenoxybenzamine treated cats, removal of calcium from the perfusing medium nearly abolished the release of noradrenaline in response to nerve stimulation. Replacement of calcium restored the noradrenaline release. The noradrenaline output/stimulus was linearly related to the log of the external calcium concentration.4. Increasing the concentration of magnesium to (10-20 mM) reduced the noradrenaline output. This depressant effect of magnesium was partially antagonized by increasing the calcium concentration of the perfusion solution.5. Divalent alkali metal earths such as barium and strontium were able to substitute for calcium. Barium substitution nearly doubled the noradrenaline output/stimulus and increased the pressor activity of the samples taken just before nerve stimulation.6. Removal of potassium from the perfusion fluid or lowering the sodium concentration to 50 mM had little effect on the release of noradrenaline. Lowering the sodium concentration to 37.5 mM or less usually abolished the noradrenaline output; this effect is attributed to blockade of nerve conduction.7. It is suggested that depolarization of post-ganglionic sympathetic nerve terminals may increase the influx of calcium ions which in turn leads to the release of noradrenaline from the nerve terminals.<Animals, Barium, pharmacology, Calcium, pharmacology, Cats, Drug Antagonism, Electric Stimulation, Magnesium, pharmacology, Neural Conduction, drug effects, Norepinephrine, metabolism, Perfusion, Phenoxybenzamine, pharmacology, Potassium, pharmacology, Spleen, physiology, Strontium, pharmacology, Sympathetic Nervous System, drug effects, physiology
16030516<Intracellular sodium concentration and resting sodium fluxes of the frog heart ventricle.<1. Using (24)Na to label the exchangeable sodium in the tissue and either [(35)S]sulphate or [(14)C]sucrose to label the extracellular spaces, the intracellular sodium concentration of frog heart ventricles was determined and found to be between about 5 and 10 m-mole/kg cell water.2. The intracellular potassium concentration, obtained by flame-photometric analysis, was approximately 163 m-mole/kg cell water.3. Two different methods were employed to study the sodium tracer efflux of resting heart ventricles. One involved a double-tracer technique, using (24)Na to indicate the release of the exchangeable tissue sodium, and (35)SO(4) to indicate, approximately, the release of extra-myocardial sodium. In the other a comparison was made of the sodium release from the tissue when it contained sodium either at the normal concentration or at a concentration enhanced by exchange with intracellular potassium.4. The magnitude of the sodium efflux from heart fibres as measured by both methods was of the order 50-100 p-mole/cm(2) sec. Simultaneously with this cellular efflux a substantial amount of sodium was released from extra-myocardial spaces and tissues.5. The net efflux of potassium ions from heart cells that occurred when heart ventricles were perfused with potassium-depleted fluids was determined. The results were used to obtain an indirect estimate, of about 2-3 p-mole/cm(2) sec, for the resting sodium influx.6. The significance of these different values of sodium efflux and influx is discussed.<Animals, Anura, Carbon Isotopes, Electrophysiology, Extracellular Space, Heart, drug effects, physiology, In Vitro Techniques, Myocardium, analysis, Perfusion, Potassium, analysis, pharmacology, Sodium, analysis, metabolism, pharmacology, Sodium Isotopes, Sulfur Isotopes, Ventricular Function
16030519<Calcium activation of frog slow muscle fibres.<1. Skinned muscle fibres were prepared from the tonus bundle of the frog iliofibularis muscle and the contractile response elicited by applied calcium ions was studied. The fibre type was determined by electron microscopy.2. Fast fibres shortened many times more rapidly than slow fibres, indicating that the slow contraction of slow fibres is an inherent property of the contractile mechanism.3. The extent of spread of contraction following local calcium application was much greater in slow than in fast fibres, a difference which is consistent with the relative sparsity of the sarcoplasmic reticulum in slow fibres.4. The ability of the sarcoplasmic reticulum of slow fibres to accumulate calcium was demonstrated by the in situ immobilization of calcium when oxalate solutions were added to the skinned fibre.<Animals, Anura, Calcium, pharmacology, In Vitro Techniques, Muscle Contraction, drug effects, physiology, Myofibrils, cytology, drug effects, physiology
16030520<Mechanics of horizontal movement of the human eye.<1. The mechanics of the muscle-eyeball system of the human has been re-investigated by careful examination of the motion of the eye after it is mechanically adducted and released by means of a suction contact lens attached to it.2. Orbital stiffness during adduction is found to be about 1.25 g/deg which is near the value of 1.2 g/deg reported by Robinson (1965) for abduction. However, the results also show that the stiffness decreases to 0.65 g/deg after approximately 5 degrees of adduction.3. It is concluded that for horizontal motion the globe may be considered as being in series with an elastic component which has a stiffness of 9.0 g/deg. This series elastance, arising from the extraocular muscles, muscle tendons, and from other orbital tissue appears to increase in stiffness as muscle innervation increases.4. The experiments show that the muscle-eyeball system of the human is heavily damped which confirms the results of Robinson (1964).5. Evidence is presented which indicates that the extraocular muscles are dominant factors in horizontal eye motion.<Eye Movements, Humans, Ocular Physiological Phenomena, Oculomotor Muscles, physiology, Vision, Ocular
16031427<Aflatoxin-producing potential of isolates of the Aspergillus flavus-oryzae group from peanuts (Arachis hypogaea).<Seventy-eight samples of farmer stock peanuts, representing peanuts grown in nine different geographical areas during 1964, were assayed for aflatoxin and examined for associated microflora. Only two samples contained more than 50 ppb of aflatoxin. Infestation by members of the Aspergillus flavus-oryzae group varied from 35 to 100% of the kernels per area and from 1 to 100% of the kernels per sample. Aflatoxin production by individual isolates ranged from 0 to 349,143 ppb under the test conditions employed. In general, the isolates produced 8 to 10 times more B(1) than B(2), and no isolate producing aflatoxins G(1) or G(2) was found. The importance of proper postharvest handling of peanuts is emphasized by the prevalence of isolates of A. flavus-oryzae capable of producing aflatoxins on farmers stock peanuts.<Aflatoxins, biosynthesis, Arachis, Aspergillus, metabolism, Chromatography, Thin Layer
16031428<Automated turbidimetric bioassay readout instrument using a multiple flow-cell system.<An instrument has been developed which permits the automatic quantitation of the turbidities of microbiological assay samples. Assay tubes were fed to the instrument at the end of the incubation period. The turbidity readings were automatically converted to digital data which were printed on International Business Machines (IBM) cards and from which potencies were calculated by an IBM computer. The instrument operated at a speed of over 240 tube readings per hour and was totally automatic in sample-mixing, readout, and data recording. The instrument is being used routinely at The Upjohn Co. for the turbidimetric bioassay of vitamins, with a coefficient of variation among repeated turbidity readings of 0.12 to 0.23%.<Automation, Biological Assay, instrumentation, Spectrophotometry, instrumentation, Vitamins, analysis
16031429<Amino acid concentrations in rumen fluid.<Methods using dialysis or ultrafiltration are described for the collection of extracellular fluid in rumen contents for analysis of amino acids. Marked differences in the concentration of aspartic acid, glutamic acid, and alanine were found in samples of either diffusate or ultrafiltrate and in clarified acidified rumen liquor. Concentrations are given for aspartic acid, glutamic acid, alanine, glycine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, valine, delta-aminovaleric acid, and leucine.<Amino Acids, analysis, Animals, Body Fluids, analysis, Carbon Isotopes, Cattle, Chromatography, Paper, Chromatography, Thin Layer, Dialysis, Electrophoresis, Rumen, analysis
16031430<Numerical taxonomy of gram-positive and catalase-positive rods isolated from frozen vegetables.<One hundred isolates from peas, beans, and corn were compared with cultures of Corynebacterium, Microbacterium, and Arthrobacter by use of numerical taxonomic procedures. Six groups (clusters), representing 75% of the isolates, resembled Corynebacteriaceae. There was some doubt regarding the genera represented because the groups were not closely related to many of the known strains. The relationship of the different groups to each other, as well as a number of their properties, is presented.<Arthrobacter, classification, Bacteria, classification, Catalase, metabolism, Corynebacterium, classification, Eubacterium, classification, Food Microbiology, Food Preservation, Vegetables
16031431<Viability of Bacillus popilliae after lyophilization of liquid nitrogen frozen cells.<The per cent viability of Bacillus popilliae after lyophilization of liquid nitrogen frozen cells was determined. Lyophilization of 9- to 12-hr cells which had been suspended in 5% sodium glutamate plus 0.5% gum tragacanth, frozen in liquid nitrogen vapor, and dried 4 to 5 hr with the ampoules exposed to room temperature resulted in survival of 64.6% of the original cells. After storage of these lyophilized preparations for 6 months at room temperature, 10.5% of the original cells were still viable.<Bacillus, metabolism, Freeze Drying, Freezing, Nitrogen
16031432<Production of aflatoxin on wheat and oats: measurement with a recording densitometer.<A method has been developed for the production of aflatoxin by growing Aspergillus flavus NRRL 3145 on solid substrate wheat. Optimal yields of 900 mug of aflatoxin G(1) and 900 mug of aflatoxin B(1) per g of substrate were obtained in 4 to 5 days at 28 C. A study of aflatoxin production on hulls and groats of oats and on whole oats by A. flavus strains NRRL 2999, NRRL 3000, and NRRL 3145 revealed that aflatoxin was produced on all three substrates, although production was very slight on hulls. Strain NRRL 3145 grown on solid substrate groats produced the largest amounts of aflatoxin: 580 mug of B(1) and 450 mug of G(1) per g of substrate. A densitometric method for reading thin-layer chromatographic plates is described; this is more objective and more accurate than the visual methods previously used for the determination of all four aflatoxins.<Aflatoxins, analysis, biosynthesis, Aspergillus, metabolism, Chromatography, Thin Layer, Densitometry, Edible Grain, Fermentation, Triticum

16031440<Countercurrent distribution studies on hamycin.<Hamycin, a polyene antifungal antibiotic, was isolated by use of countercurrent distribution. A pattern was obtained by plotting the absorption at 383 mmu of the contents of the various tubes against the tube numbers. The results indicated that the antibiotic contained three fractions, a major fraction (peak 2) comprising 48% of the total activity and two minor fractions (peak 1 and peak 3) comprising 3.62 and 11.32%, respectively, of the total activity. The solid material was isolated by pooling the contents of the tubes containing the major fraction, concentrating this in vacuo, and cooling. The antibiotic activities of the three peaks were evaluated by use of a cup-plate assay method with Paecilomyces varioti as test organism. All three components showed antibiotic activity; however, the preparation obtained from the major fraction showed approximately a 7-fold increase in antibiotic activity, a doubling of the E(1cm) (1%) value at 383 mmu, and approximately a 2.5-fold decrease in the amino acid content in comparison with the starting material. There was an apparent correlation obtained by plotting the curves of the absorption at 383 mmu of the different tubes comprising the major fraction and their biological activities.<Antifungal Agents, analysis, Chromatography, Paper, Countercurrent Distribution, Spectrum Analysis
16031441<Lactobacilli in ensiled high-moisture corn.<Aerobic mesophilic bacteria, molds, yeasts, and Lactobacillus species were enumerated at various intervals of the ensiling process of high-moisture corn (HMC). A total of 466 isolates of Lactobacillus were identified to determine the species of Lactobacillus associated with ensiled HMC and remoistened corn. The numbers of aerobic bacteria in the ensiled HMC increased to 10(8) per gram within 1 week and remained at this level throughout the storage period. The numbers of aerobic bacteria in the remoistened corn increased to 10(9) per gram and remained at this level during the 60-day storage period, after which they increased rapidly. Yeasts were the predominant microflora of the ensiled HMC. Mold numbers were low in the silos, but were very high in the remoistened corn, especially toward the end of the 60-day storage period. The species of Lactobacillus most frequently isolated from the ensiled HMC were L. plantarum, 52% of the isolates; L. brevis, 19% of the isolates; L. brevis (atypical), 15%; L. fermenti, 11%; and L. buchneri, 3%. The lactic acid bacteria, therefore, are the predominant bacterial flora of ensiled HMC, as they are of other types of plant forages that undergo similar fermentations.<Animal Feed, Bacteria, isolation &amp; purification, Computers, Food Microbiology, Fungi, isolation &amp; purification, Lactobacillus, isolation &amp; purification, Temperature, Zea mays

16031443<Stability and effects of some pesticides in soil.<The influence of 29 pesticides on CO(2) production and nitrification by soil microorganisms was determined. A few compounds were stable but without significant effect in soil (chlorinated hydrocarbons), some persisted and depressed respiration and nitrification (carbamates, cyclodienes, phenylureas, thiolcarbamates), and others displayed toxicity but were transformed by soil microorganisms (amides, anilides, organophosphates, phenylcarbamates, triazines). Some compounds of the last type induced an initial increase and subsequent decrease in CO(2) production by soil. No simple explanation of this effect is possible, but the results of studies of model systems having established activities suggest that in soil any one or a combination of the following mechanisms is responsible for the observed complex relation of CO(2) production to time: (i) a pesticide acts to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation in a manner analogous to 2,4-dinitrophenol; (ii) a pesticide lacking antimicrobial action is oxidized in part and transformed to a stable and toxic product; (iii) a pesticide that is selectively toxic inhibits CO(2) production by sensitive microorganisms but is subject to oxidation without detoxification by other members of the microbial population that are resistant to its initial action. Pesticide concentrations greatly in excess of those recommended for agricultural and home use were required to produce an effect, and supplementary organic matter (glucose) tended to reduce pesticide toxicity and increase the microbial degradation of pesticides in soil.<Bacteria, drug effects, metabolism, Carbon Dioxide, biosynthesis, DDT, pharmacology, Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane, pharmacology, Dieldrin, pharmacology, Nitrates, biosynthesis, Pesticides, pharmacology, Soil Microbiology, drug effects
16031444<Antibiotic control of Mycoplasma in tissue culture.<Seven of eight strains of Mycoplasma (PPLO) were found to be sensitive to the deoxystreptamines, certain macrolides, and the tetracyclines. These antibiotics are relative noncytotoxic. Kanamycin and tetracycline were useful in eliminating PPLO (pleuropneumonia-like organisms) strain Squibb no. 1 from a HeLa cell line which was deliberately contaminated with PPLO. Repeated exposure of M. laidlawii type B cells to neomycin resulted in a 50-fold increase in resistance, and the resistant strain was also resistant to gentamicin, kanamycin, neomycin, and paromomycin. A tetracycline-resistant strain of this culture was found to be resistant to 7-chlortetracycline, 7-chlor-6-demethyltetracycline, and 5-hydroxytetracycline. One PPLO strain, Squibb no. 2, derived from a contaminated HeLa cell culture, was resistant to all antibiotics studied.<Anti-Bacterial Agents, pharmacology, Drug Resistance, Microbial, HeLa Cells, Humans, Mycoplasma, drug effects, Tetracycline, pharmacology
16032195<The effects of cross-innervation on the myoglobin concentration of tonic and phasic muscles.<1. The myoglobin concentrations of m. soleus and m. flexor digitorum longus (F.D.L.) were estimated spectrophotometrically in normal cats.2. In another group of cats the nerves to m. soleus and F.D.L. were self-united in one limb and cross-united in the opposite limb and the myoglobin concentrations of m. soleus and F.D.L. in both limbs were estimated 6 months later.3. After self-union of the nerves the F.D.L./soleus myoglobin ratio was not significantly different from that of normal cats.4. After cross-union of the nerves the F.D.L./soleus myoglobin ratio was significantly greater than that of both normal cats and cats after self-union of their nerves.<Animals, Cats, Female, Male, Muscles, analysis, innervation, metabolism, Myoglobin, analysis
16032196<Monoamine oxidase inhibition: effect on 5-hydroxytryptamine output from perfused third ventricle and body temperature.<1. In cats anaesthetized with pentobarbitone sodium the third ventricle was perfused with artificial c.s.f., the effluent was collected in 30 min samples and assayed for 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) on the rat stomach-strip preparation. Rectal temperature was monitored continuously.2. On perfusion of artificial c.s.f. through the third ventricle, small amounts of 5-HT appeared in the effluent; the amounts decreased with successive samples.3. When tranylcypromine (Parnate), an inhibitor of amine oxidase, was added to the perfusion fluid and perfusion was continued, the 5-HT output increased. This increase was associated with shivering and a rise in temperature which was not, however, maintained.4. When tranylcypromine was injected intraperitoneally, during the fall in temperature produced by the pentobarbitone sodium anaesthesia, the 5-HT output also increased, shivering occurred and the fall in temperature was halted or reversed. The effect on temperature was maintained.5. When the cat was killed and perfusion was continued, the 5-HT output, already elevated by the tranylcypromine before death, increased even further in the next few samples.<Animals, Body Temperature, Body Temperature Regulation, drug effects, Cats, Cerebral Ventricles, drug effects, physiology, Female, In Vitro Techniques, Male, Muscle Contraction, drug effects, Perfusion, Rats, Serotonin, physiology, Shivering, Stomach, drug effects, Tranylcypromine, pharmacology
16032197<Mean carbon dioxide tension in the brain after carbonic anhydrase inhibition.<1. Measurements of the CO(2) tensions in arterial blood, in blood from the superior sagittal sinus, in cisternal cerebrospinal fluid, and on the surface of the cerebral cortex were made in spontaneously breathing anaesthetized cats and rats after inhibition of carbonic anhydrase with acetazolamide in doses of 50-150 mg/kg.2. After an acetazolamide dose of 50 mg/kg in cats there was a mean increase in the c.s.f. CO(2) tension of 8 mm Hg; after a dose of 100 mg/kg the corresponding mean increase was 13 mm Hg.3. Since the CO(2) tension measured in venous blood was only moderately influenced by the acetazolamide, the normal P(CO2) difference between venous blood and c.s.f. was markedly reduced. The apparent arterial CO(2) tension, i.e. the CO(2) tension measured in vitro, always changed to the same extent as the c.s.f. CO(2) tension.4. The findings were confirmed by measurements of the CO(2) tension on the surface of the cerebral cortex, and by measurements of the blood and c.s.f. CO(2) tensions in the rat.5. It is concluded that the mean tissue CO(2) tension of the brain can be estimated from the measured arterial CO(2) tension, even under conditions of carbonic anhydrase inhibition.<Acetazolamide, pharmacology, Anesthesia, Animals, Carbon Dioxide, analysis, blood, cerebrospinal fluid, Cats, Cerebral Cortex, analysis, drug effects, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Pentobarbital, pharmacology, Phenobarbital, pharmacology, Rats
16032198<The inhibition of induced motor activity in transplanted fundic pouches.<1. An increase in motor activity of transplanted fundic pouches can be produced repeatedly by an alkaline buffer solution in the duodenum.2. The response can be abolished by small doses of a cholecystokinin-pancreozymin extract.3. The secretagogues, olive oil and peptone will inhibit the response when introduced into the duodenum.4. Acetylcholine in the duodenum will also inhibit the effect.5.

16032199<The respiration of the anterior byssus retractor muscle of Mytilus edulis (ABRM) after a phasic contraction.<1. The oxygen consumption of isolated anterior byssus retractor muscle of Mytilus edulis (ABRM) has been measured at rest and after phasic contractions induced by a.c. stimulation.2. The respiration was measured with a Clark oxygen electrode in successive periods of 5 or 15 min, at 20 degrees C.3. The resting respiration is 71.8 +/- 2.4 n-moles O(2)/g wet weight.min (mean +/- S.E., n = 70). It is increased by a release and decreased by a passive stretch.4. After phasic stimulation of up to 30 sec the respiration is increased and returns to a slightly higher level than the resting level in an exponential fashion with a time constant of about 10 min.5. The duration of stimulation does not change the time course of the excess respiration but it affects its magnitude. The amount of extra oxygen consumed, in n-moles O(2)/g, is made up of a constant amount, 449 +/- 102, and an amount that depends on the duration of stimulation (t, sec), which is given by t x 13.2 +/- 4.3. When due account is taken for the tension developed, these parameters become 83.1 +/- 20.7 and t x 1.24 +/- 0.66 n-moles O(2)/g muscle and kg/cm(2) of tension. This regression analysis is based on forty-eight data, with a residual error based on 5 degrees of freedom.6. Release of the tension after the last stimulus of a 30 sec tetanus reduces by half the extra oxygen consumed during the recovery whereas the same release applied 5 min later has a much smaller effect. This suggests that relaxation is an active process.7. From these measurements of the recovery metabolism the energy cost of the contraction was estimated and compared with this cost in vertebrate striated muscle. The constant item has about the same magnitude, but the item related to the duration of stimulation is about 250 times smaller.<Animals, Electric Stimulation, In Vitro Techniques, Mollusca, Muscle Contraction, physiology, Muscles, metabolism, Oxygen Consumption
16032200<The central release of acetylcholine during consciousness and after brain lesions.<1. Acetylcholine (ACh) has been collected from the visual cortex of anaesthetized rabbits during stimulation of the lateral geniculate body and after cutting central nervous pathways. ACh has also been collected from the visual cortex of conscious, free-moving rabbits.2. After a unilateral ;vertical' lesion separating the geniculate body from more centrally situated nuclei, ACh release evoked from the contralateral cortex by geniculate body stimulation was abolished but evoked release from the ipsilateral cortex was only reduced.3. After a bilateral, ;horizontal' lesion separating the thalamic nuclei from the reticular formation, unilateral geniculate stimulation gave an increased ACh release from the ipsilateral but not from the contralateral visual cortex.4. The ;vertical' and ;horizontal' lesions had no permanent effect on the spontaneous release of ACh from the visual cortex.5. Unilateral destruction of the geniculate body reduced the spontaneous release of ACh from the ipsilateral cortex but did not affect the contralateral release.6. The spontaneous and directly evoked ACh release from chronically undercut areas of cortex was found to be considerably lower than from intact areas of cortex.7. A high output of ACh was obtained from the visual cortex of conscious, free-moving rabbits. The rate of ACh release was closely related to the activity and state of arousal of the animals.8. These results support an earlier suggestion that two major ascending cholinergic systems exist in the rabbit brain. One pathway is the non-specific reticulo-cortical tract responsible for cortical arousal and the other is the more specific thalamo-cortical pathway associated with augmenting and repetitive after-discharge responses. The functional significance of these two cholinergic pathways and their role in the conscious animal are discussed.<Acetylcholine, physiology, Animals, Brain, physiology, Consciousness, Electric Stimulation, Geniculate Bodies, physiology, Parasympathetic Nervous System, physiology, Rabbits, Wakefulness
16032201<An upper limit to the number of sodium channels in nerve membrane?<1. A small volume of artificial sea water containing 300 nM tetrodotoxin (TTX) was applied successively to seven lobster nerve trunks and the cumulative uptake of toxin investigated by bio-assay.2. Light and electron microscopy indicated that the nerve trunks had a total axonal area of 0.7 x 10(4) cm(2)/g.3. Sodium analysis gave a sodium space for the nerve trunks of 30%.4. The amount of toxin taken up by the cells in 1 g of nerve is less than 1.6 x 10(-11) moles.5. It is argued that there are probably fewer than 13 sodium channels/mu(2) axon in lobster nerve.<Action Potentials, Animals, Cell Membrane Permeability, drug effects, Crustacea, Electrophysiology, Neurons, drug effects, metabolism, Sodium, analysis, Tetrodotoxin, pharmacology, Toxins, Biological, pharmacology
16032202<Receptive fields and trigger features of ganglion cells in the visual streak of the rabbits retina.<1. A survey of the properties of retinal ganglion cells in the central part of the rabbit retina has been carried out.2. The five types of unit previously encountered in the peripheral retina were also found in the central region. Their receptive fields were smaller, and tended to be oval-shaped with the long axis horizontal.3. In addition, three new types were discovered: orientation-selective cells, local-edge-detectors, uniformity-detectors.4. Orientation-selective cells were sensitive to either vertically or horizontally extended targets. Analysis suggested they were modified concentric units with an incomplete antagonistic surround.5. Local-edge-detectors responded to the appearance or movement of a contrasting border within the receptive field. They were inhibited by similar stimulation of the region surrounding the receptive field. Detailed attention was given to the demonstration of edge-detection.6. Uniformity detectors had a relatively high level of ongoing activity in the absence of stimulation. All forms of stimulation (lights flashed on or off, movement of darker or lighter targets) produced a diminution or cessation of ongoing activity.7. The results are compared with behaviour described in other species.<Animals, Electrophysiology, Ganglia, physiology, Rabbits, Retina, innervation, physiology, Vision, Ocular, physiology
16032203<The oxygen consumption of mammalian non-myelinated nerve fibres at rest and during activity.<1. A study has been made of the oxygen consumption of non-myelinated nerve fibres of rabbit desheathed cervical vagus nerves at rest and during activity.2. The average resting oxygen consumption (Q(r)) was 0.0924 mumole/g. min at 21 degrees C. Stimulation for 1-3 min at 3/sec caused an extra oxygen consumption (Q(s)) of 816 p-mole/g.shock.3. When the frequency of stimulation was increased, to 10/sec and 30/sec, Q(s) fell. When the frequency was decreased, to 1/sec and 0.3/sec, Q(s) increased slightly.4. When the temperature was decreased, Q(r) fell; when the temperature was increased, Q(s) also increased. Temperature similarly affected Q(s) with high frequencies of stimulation, but had relatively little effect on Q(s) at low frequencies of stimulation.5. An isolated single shock seemed to produce an increase in oxygen consumption of about 1200 p-mole/g, and this value was largely independent of temperature.6. When part of the sodium in the Locke solution was replaced by barium, Q(r) decreased (by 12%) whereas Q(s) increased (by 87%).7. Veratrine (1 mug/ml.) increased both Q(r) (by 142%) and Q(s) (by 361%).8. Acetylcholine (1.7 mM) increased Q(r) (by 32%).9. When nerves were transferred to potassium-free solutions there was little change in Q(r), and Q(s) fell slightly (by 8%).10. When the potassium concentration in the Locke solution was increased 4-fold, Q(r) increased (by 27%).11. Salicylate (1-10 mM) increased Q(r) (by 24%) and abolished Q(s).12. When the sodium of Locke solution was replaced by lithium, Q(r) decreased (by 19%) and Q(s) was abolished.13. In sodium-Locke solution ouabain (100 muM) decreased Q(r) (by 26%) and abolished Q(s). In lithium-Locke solution ouabain also decreased Q(r) (by 28%).14. All or nearly all of the oxygen consumed at rest or during activity seemed to be used to pump potassium ions into, and sodium ions out of, the axoplasm.15. The K/O(2) ratio during pumping was about 5.0.<Acetylcholine, pharmacology, Action Potentials, Animals, Barium, pharmacology, Electric Stimulation, In Vitro Techniques, Lithium, pharmacology, Myelin Sheath, physiology, Neurons, drug effects, metabolism, physiology, Ouabain, pharmacology, Oxygen Consumption, Potassium, pharmacology, Rabbits, Salicylates, pharmacology, Sodium, pharmacology, Temperature, Vagus Nerve, metabolism, Veratrine, pharmacology
16032204<The reflex effects of alterations in lung volume on systemic vascular resistance in the dog.<1. The reflex effects of alterations in lung volume on systemic vascular resistance have been studied in anaesthetized dogs under conditions in which the systemic circulation was perfused at constant blood flow. The pressures in the isolated perfused carotid sinuses and aortic arch, and the arterial blood P(O2) and P(CO2) were maintained constant.2. A maintained inflation of the lungs produced by injection of air into the trachea caused a fall in systemic arterial perfusion pressure, indicating vasodilatation. The size of the systemic vasodilator response varied directly with the pressure and volume of gas used to inflate the lungs. A similar effect was observed when the tidal volume of lungs ventilated by an intermittent positive pressure was increased.3. Collapse of the lungs by creating a pneumothorax in closed-chest spontaneously breathing animals evoked a systemic vasoconstrictor response which was reversed when the lungs were re-expanded.4. These vasodilator responses were abolished by dividing the pulmonary branches of the thoracic vagosympathetic nerves. Evidence is presented that the afferent fibres run in the cervical vagosympathetic nerves and through the stellate ganglia.5. The responses were unaffected by atropine, but were abolished by hexamethonium, guanethidine and by bretylium tosylate, indicating that they are mediated via the sympathetic nervous system.6. Evidence is presented that the lungs are a constant course of afferent impulses inhibiting the ;vasomotor centre', and that the lung inflation-systemic vasodilator reflex is a potential mechanism operating in eupnoeic breathing.<Animals, Aorta, Atropine, pharmacology, Blood Circulation, Blood Gas Analysis, Bretylium Compounds, pharmacology, Carotid Sinus, Dogs, Female, Guanethidine, pharmacology, Hexamethonium Compounds, pharmacology, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Lung, innervation, physiology, Male, Neural Conduction, Perfusion, Pressoreceptors, Reflex, Respiration, physiology, Vagus Nerve, physiology, Vascular Resistance, physiology, Vasomotor System, drug effects, physiology, Veratrine
16032205<The effect of noradrenaline on the permeability of depolarized intestinal smooth muscle to inorganic ions.<1. Radio-isotopes have been used to study the effect of noradrenaline on the permeability of the taenia of the guinea-pig caecum to inorganic ions. The preparations were bathed at either 10 or 20 degrees C in solutions containing a high concentration of potassium, in order to depolarize the fibres and so avoid ionic movements secondary to changes in membrane potential.2. Under these conditions noradrenaline increased both inward and outward fluxes of potassium whilst having little effect on the exchange of chloride.3. No effect of noradrenaline on the uptake of sodium could be detected, whereas carbachol (carbamyl choline chloride), applied under identical conditions, caused a significant increase at a concentration chosen to match the effect of noradrenaline on potassium exchange.4. These results are discussed in relation to the hypothesis that an increase in potassium permeability contributes to the inhibitory actions of noradrenaline on intestinal smooth muscle.<Animals, Biological Transport, Carbachol, pharmacology, Cecum, drug effects, Cell Membrane Permeability, Chlorides, metabolism, Guinea Pigs, In Vitro Techniques, Membrane Potentials, Muscle, Smooth, drug effects, physiology, Norepinephrine, pharmacology, Potassium, metabolism, Potassium Isotopes, Radiometry, Sodium, metabolism
16032206<The role of alpha- and beta- adrenergic receptors in some actions of catecholamines on intestinal smooth muscle.<1. Experiments were carried out to determine the type of adrenergic receptor concerned in the action of noradrenaline in increasing the rate of exchange of potassium ions in the taenia of the guinea-pig caecum. The preparations were bathed in potassium-rich solutions in order to depolarize the muscle fibres and so eliminate changes in potassium flux secondary to alterations in membrane potential.2. Noradrenaline was more effective than isoprenaline in increasing both the influx and efflux of (42)K, suggesting that the alpha-receptors were involved. This action on potassium permeability was abolished by the alpha-blocking agent phentolamine (10(-7) g/ml.), the beta-blocking agent pronethalol (10(-7) g/ml.) being without effect.3. In contrast, isoprenaline was about 30 times more active than noradrenaline in inhibiting calcium contractures of the depolarized taenia, suggesting that here the beta-receptors were concerned. This was confirmed by showing that this action of noradrenaline was effectively antagonized by pronethalol, again at 10(-7) g/ml., but not by the same concentration of phentolamine.4. Carbachol contractures in quiescent preparations bathed in Krebs solution at 17 degrees C could be inhibited by both noradrenaline and isoprenaline. Noradrenaline was found to be more active under these conditions, and this action was antagonized by phentolamine (and piperoxane), but not by pronethalol, at the same concentrations as before.5. These findings confirm that the alpha- and beta-receptors are quite distinct in their actions. Nevertheless, under physiological conditions, both may contribute to the inhibitory actions of catecholamines on intestinal smooth muscle.<Animals, Carbachol, pharmacology, Cecum, drug effects, Cell Membrane Permeability, Chlorides, pharmacology, Electrophysiology, Guinea Pigs, In Vitro Techniques, Isoproterenol, pharmacology, Membrane Potentials, Muscle Contraction, drug effects, Muscle, Smooth, drug effects, Norepinephrine, pharmacology, Potassium, pharmacology, Potassium Isotopes, Sensory Receptor Cells, drug effects, Sympathetic Nervous System, drug effects, Sympatholytics, pharmacology
16032207<The laminar organization of dorsal horn and effects of descending impulses.<1. An examination of the physiological properties of cells in cat lumbar dorsal horn shows that there are three horizontal laminae which correspond approximately to Rexed (1952) laminae 4, 5, and 6.2. A summary diagram (Fig. 9) suggests the relation of the laminae to each other and to afferent and descending fibres. All three laminae respond to cutaneous stimulation but only lamina 6 responds to movement. By comparing responses of cells in decerebrate and spinal preparations, it is shown that the brain stem inhibits cutaneous responses and enhances movement responses. Pyramidal tract stimulation affects cells in laminae 4, 5, and 6.3. Cells in lamina 4 have small cutaneous receptive fields and respond as though many different types of specific cutaneous afferents converge on them. Cells in lamina 5 respond as though many cells of lamina 4 converge on them. In the decerebrate animal the responses of lamina 5 cells habituate to repeated light pressure stimuli but the cells remain responsive to new stimuli in other parts of their receptive field. Impulses descending from the brain stem can switch the modality of lamina 6 cells from cutaneous to proprioceptive.<Animals, Brain Stem, physiology, Cats, Decerebrate State, Electrophysiology, Muscle Contraction, physiology, Neurons, drug effects, physiology, Pentobarbital, pharmacology, Pyramidal Tracts, physiology, Sensory Receptor Cells, physiology, Skin Physiological Phenomena, Spinal Cord, physiology
16032208<The regional distribution of the nerve-stimulating phosphopeptide (nerveside, substance B) in the central nervous system.<1. The nerve-stimulating phosphopeptide, nerveside, is present mainly in the cerebrum and brain stem, while the cerebellum contains only a trace amount of it.2. Nerveside is uniformly distributed over all parts of the cerebral cortex.3. The cerebral cortex contains the greatest concentration of nerveside. If the nerveside activity of 1 g cerebral cortex is expressed as 100 then the relative activities of the other parts of the C.N.S. are hippocampus 41, caudate nucleus 21, diencephalon (without hypothalamus) 24, midbrain 19, pons 7, medulla 12 and cerebellum 6.4. The nerveside activity of the hypothalamus is the same as that of the cerebral cortex.5. The pattern of distribution of nerveside in the C.N.S. suggests that it may be part of a corticipetal or corticifugal system.<Animals, Biological Assay, Brain, metabolism, Brain Stem, metabolism, Cerebellum, metabolism, Cerebral Cortex, metabolism, Dogs, In Vitro Techniques, Intestine, Small, drug effects, Muscle Contraction, drug effects, Muscle, Smooth, drug effects, Phosphopeptides, metabolism, pharmacology, Rabbits
16032503<Relation between iron uptake, pH of growth medium, and penicillinase formation in Staphylococcus aureus.<The uptake of iron and the formation of penicillinase was examined in cultures of wild-type Staphylococcus aureus. Uptake of iron was about twice as great at pH 4.7 as at pH 7.4 At pH 4.7, increase in iron uptake in the range of 1.0 to 4.0 mug per mg of bacterial protein was associated with a progressive increase in the rate of penicillinase formation, but a direct correlation between cellular iron content and rate of enzyme formation was not demonstrated. Addition of iron to deferrated medium enhanced penicillinase formation at pH 6.5 to 7.4 two- to fourfold in cultures induced with benzylpenicillin and in uninduced cultures. To demonstrate an effect on the uninduced cells, it was necessary to increase iron uptake by preliminary incubation of cells with iron in buffer. Calcium and certain other ions depressed iron uptake at acidic and at neutral pH, and, presumably as a result of this action, depressed the formation of penicillinase. Iron did not enhance penicillinase formation at pH 4.7 by two penicillinase constitutive mutants nor by wild-type cells undergoing induction at pH 6.5 by cephalosporin C or methicillin. After removal of cephalosporin C or methicillin during an early phase of induction, residual synthesis of enzyme was increased by prior uptake of iron. The results are considered compatible with the concept that uptake of iron, especially at acidic pH, interferes with the formation or function of penicillinase repressor.<Bacterial Proteins, analysis, Calcium, pharmacology, Culture Media, Enzyme Repression, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Iron, metabolism, pharmacology, Iron Isotopes, Penicillinase, biosynthesis, Staphylococcus, metabolism
16032504<Ultraviolet-induced changes in the infectivity of Agrobacterium tumefaciens.<The infectivity of Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain B6 irradiated with short-wavelength ultraviolet light was followed as a function of dose. Previously reported enhancements of B6 infectivity by ultraviolet irradiation, in samples inoculated after 1.75 hr of dark incubation at 27 C, or immediately following irradiation, were found to occur most frequently after losses in cell viability of 60% and of 90% or more, respectively. Changes in colony-forming ability and tumor-initiating ability with increasing dose showed no obvious correlation until the maximal infectivity promotion of samples inoculated immediately after irradiation was reached. Thereafter, both bacterial responses typically decreased in parallel. With low dose rates, infectivity promotions were obtained with less than 10% loss in cell viability. Data for tumor appearance and tumor growth resulting from inoculations with irradiated cultures showed no significant differences from controls, nor did the age of the bacterial culture or age of the host plant influence the response. The infectivity promotion appears to result from an increase in the proportion of viable cells that will subsequently initiate tumors. The characteristics of this ultraviolet infectivity promotion are shown to be most similar to those found in prophage and bacteriocin induction.<Plant Tumors, microbiology, Radiation Effects, Rhizobium, radiation effects, Ultraviolet Rays
16032505<Antigenic relationship of Brucella ovis and Brucella melitensis.<Immune sera were prepared in rabbits by the injection of living and acetone-killed cells of Brucella ovis and smooth and rough B. melitensis. The use of whole-cell antigens in agglutination and agglutinin-absorption tests revealed little relationship between B. ovis and smooth B. melitensis, although there was extensive cross-agglutination between B. ovis and rough B. melitensis. The use of water-soluble antigens prepared from ultrasonically treated cells of the three strains revealed extensive cross-reactions in indirect hemagglutination, agar gel precipitation, and immunoelectrophoresis tests, as well as in allergic skin tests in rabbits. The most definitive results were obtained with the immunoelectrophoresis technique. B. ovis antigen produced at least 11 lines with its homologous serum. All were removed by absorption of the serum with rough B. melitensis antigen. All but three were removed by absorption with smooth B. melitensis antigen. Smooth B. melitensis antigen produced 11 lines with its homologous serum, and all but 3 were removed by absorption with B. ovis antigen. Rough B. melitensis produced nine lines with its homologous serum, and eight were removed by B. ovis antigen. The extensive cross-reactions between soluble antigens of B. ovis and B. melitensis are added evidence that B. ovis belongs in the genus Brucella.<Animals, Antigens, metabolism, Brucella, immunology, Hemagglutination Tests, Immunoelectrophoresis, Precipitin Tests, Rabbits
16032506<Biosynthesis of phenylalanine from phenylacetate by Chromatium and Rhodospirillum rubrum.<Cultures of Chromatium strain D and Rhodospirillum rubrum incorporated (14)C from phenylacetate-1-(14)C during anaerobic growth. The radioactivity in the protein fraction of cells was mainly in phenylalanine. Phenylalanine from Chromatium cells grown in phenylacetate-1-(14)C was labeled at carbon 2. Incorporation of phenylacetate by Chromatium was decreased in the presence of exogenous phenylalanine, and de novo synthesis of phenylalanine from bicarbonate was less in medium containing either phenylalanine or phenylacetate. These organisms, and also certain anaerobic rumen bacteria, apparently carboxylate phenylacetate to synthesize the phenylalanine carbon skeleton. The mechanism of the carboxylation is unknown; however, it appears to be dependent upon anaerobic conditions, since R. rubrum did not synthesize phenylalanine from phenylacetate during aerobic growth in the dark.<Autoradiography, Bicarbonates, metabolism, Carbon Isotopes, Chromatium, metabolism, Chromatography, Paper, Oxygen, pharmacology, Phenylacetates, metabolism, Phenylalanine, biosynthesis, Rhodospirillum, metabolism
16032507<Melanins and resistance of fungi to lysis.<Hyphal walls of Aspergillus phoenicis and Sclerotium rolfsii are composed of large amounts of glucose- and N-acetylhexosamine-containing polysaccharides, and the walls are extensively digested by streptomycete culture filtrates or by a mixture of purified chitinase and beta-(1 --&gt; 3) glucanase preparations with the release of the monomeric units. A. phoenicis conidial walls also contain polymers of glucose and N-acetylhexosamine, but these walls are resistant to digestion by microorganisms or the enzyme combination active on the hyphae. When the melanin-containing spicules were removed from the spore surface, however, the chitinase and glucanase partially digested the underlying structural components. Microorganisms decomposing hyphal walls of S. rolfsii did not attack the melanin-covered sclerotia produced by this fungus. No microorganism capable of lysing two fungi, Rhizoctonia solani and Cladosporium sp., producing hyphae containing abundant melanin was found. The ecological significance of these findings and possible mechanisms for the protective influence associated with melanins are discussed.<Aspergillus, drug effects, Chitinases, pharmacology, Chromatography, Paper, Fungi, drug effects, Glucosyltransferases, pharmacology, Melanins, pharmacology, Polysaccharides, metabolism, Streptomyces, enzymology
16032508<Mechanisms of regulation of urease biosynthesis in Proteus rettgeri.<Urease of Proteus rettgeri is an inducible enzyme synthesized specifically in the presence of urea; urea analogues did not act as inducers. Once initiated, the biosynthesis of the enzyme proceeded as a constant fraction of the total protein formed. The rate of urease formation was affected by the carbon source used. In comparison with glycerol, glucose inhibited enzyme synthesis. The addition of ammonium ions to the inducing medium also decreased the rate of urease biosynthesis, and when ammonium ions were present urease activity and urea transport across the cell membrane were inhibited. A kinetic analysis of urease inhibition by ammonium ions, by use of a partially purified preparation of urease, showed that it was a competitive inhibition.<Cell Membrane Permeability, Enzyme Induction, Enzymes, Glucose, pharmacology, Kinetics, Proteus, enzymology, metabolism, Quaternary Ammonium Compounds, pharmacology, Thiourea, pharmacology, Urease, biosynthesis
16032509<Uptake and utilization of amino acids by resting cells of Nitrosomonas europaea.<Incorporation of selected amino acids by resting cells was studied with regard to effects of concentration, rate and extent of incorporation, cellular distribution, effect of ammonium ion on uptake, and competitive effects. l-Aspartic acid, l-alanine, l-serine, and glycine presented at trace levels were incorporated at rates ranging from 0.11 to 8.2 mumumoles per mg (dry weight) per minute, and maximal incorporation was 11 to 333 mumumoles per mg (dry weight). When glycine and aspartic acid were supplied at substrate level, the rate of incorporation increased 14- and 109-fold, respectively. The presence of ammonium ion further increased both the rate and extent of uptake of glycine and aspartic acid. The distribution of cellular radioactivity arising from (14)C amino acids indicated that cell pool radioactivity was concentrated from 1.2- to 24.5-fold over the external medium. Aspartic acid pool radioactivity accounted for 50% or more of the total cellular radioactivity, whereas radioactivity in glycine and serine pools dropped from initially high levels to 20 to 25% during incubation. The decrease in pool radioactivity with both glycine and serine was accompanied by an increase in other fractions, especially in the cell residue. The growth-inhibiting amino acid l-valine, supplied at substrate level, contributed more carbon per milligram (dry weight) than any other amino acid studied. l-Leucine, in the presence of l-valine, was observed to decrease valine incorporation.<Amino Acids, metabolism, Aspartic Acid, metabolism, Carbon Isotopes, Glycine, metabolism, Nitrosomonas, metabolism, Quaternary Ammonium Compounds, pharmacology, Serine, metabolism, Valine, metabolism
16032510<Influence of isoleucine upon quinomycin biosynthesis by Streptomyces sp. 732.<When dl-isoleucine was added to an ammonium nitrate-maltose medium during cultivation of Streptomyces sp. 732, quinomycin B formation was selectively enhanced (from 3 to 70% of the quinomycin mixture) and quinomycin C synthesis was inhibited completely. In addition, two new quinomycins, designated quinomycins D and E, were produced in the presence of isoleucine. These compounds were found to contain N-methylalloisoleucine. In experiments with isoleucine enantiomorphs, it was determined that the order of effectiveness for quinomycin B synthesis was dl-isoleucine &gt; d-isoleucine &gt; l-isoleucine. The extent to which quinomycin B synthesis is enhanced depends upon the concentration and the time of addition of isoleucine to the medium. The effect of dl-isoleucine was reduced to some extent by the addition of l-valine. It is conceivable that amino acids which are precursors of the N-methylamino acids in quinomycin can regulate quinomycin formation.<Anti-Bacterial Agents, biosynthesis, Chromatography, Paper, Isoleucine, pharmacology, Leucine, pharmacology, Methionine, pharmacology, Streptomyces, drug effects, metabolism, Threonine, pharmacology, Tryptophan, pharmacology, Valine, pharmacology
16032511<Effect of oxygen on viability and substrate utilization in Chromatium.<Chromatium D can be exposed to oxygen for prolonged periods without any loss in motility or viability. Oxygen did not affect the rate of thiosulfate disappearance from the media, the oxidation of the inner sulfur atom of thiosulfate to sulfate, or the conversion of the outer sulfur atom of thiosulfate to intracellular sulfur, but it did inhibit the oxidation of intracellular sulfur to sulfate. Oxygen partially inhibited the uptake of pyruvate from the medium, but had little effect on the uptake of acetate. The distribution of label from pyruvate-2-(14)C into various cell fractions under aerobic conditions differed only slightly from that obtained under anaerobic conditions. Cells utilizing acetate-2-(14)C aerobically converted the majority of the metabolized acetate into a cell fraction with the solubility characteristics of poly-beta-hydroxybutyric acid, whereas under anaerobic conditions the acetate was distributed throughout the other cell fractions. Oxygen completely prevented the synthesis of bacteriochlorophyll.<Acetates, pharmacology, Carbon Isotopes, Chlorophyll, biosynthesis, Chromatium, drug effects, metabolism, Oxygen, pharmacology, Pyruvates, pharmacology, Sulfur, metabolism, Sulfur Isotopes, Thiosulfates, metabolism
16032512<Inhibition of Shigella flexneri by the normal intestinal flora. I. Mechanisms of inhibition by Klebsiella.<Growth curves were plotted for Shigella flexneri and Klebsiella (Aerobacter aerogenes) multiplying in pure and mixed culture. In mixed culture, Klebsiella inhibited Shigella. Exponential growth was interrupted and Shigella entered into a logarithmic death phase. An analysis of cultures at the time inhibition occurred revealed that formic and acetic acids produced by Klebsiella were responsible for the inhibition of Shigella. Klebsiella strongly reduced the culture medium. The volatile fatty acids, operating under reduced conditions, exerted a bactericidal effect on Shigella. Results are discussed with reference to the possible role of volatile fatty acids as factors responsible for Shigella inhibition in vivo.<Acetates, pharmacology, Chromatography, Paper, Culture Media, Fatty Acids, pharmacology, Formates, pharmacology, Intestines, growth &amp; development, Klebsiella, drug effects, growth &amp; development, metabolism, Shigella, drug effects, growth &amp; development
16032513<Selection of characters for an Adansonian analysis of mycobacterial taxonomy.<Tests which are most frequently employed to provide characters for numerical analysis of bacterial taxonomy provide little differentiation among the slow-growing members of the genus Mycobacterium. A special scheme was proposed to deal with this problem. Characters were based, to some extent, on quantitative reactions to tests, and were defined, for each test, in terms of natural clustering behavior of a large collection of assorted strains. Inter- and intrataxon analyses were based on comparisons of reaction patterns with tentative hypothetical median strain patterns. This permitted the analysis of larger numbers of cultures than can be practically studied in a conventional n x n table.<Catalase, metabolism, Iron, metabolism, Mycobacterium, classification, metabolism, Sulfatases, metabolism, Surface-Active Agents, pharmacology
16032514<Deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis during exponential growth and microcyst formation in Myxococcus xanthus.<Myxococcus xanthus in exponential phase with a generation time of 270 min contained a period of 50 min during which deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis did not take place. After induction of microcysts by the glycerol technique, the DNA content increased 19%. Autoradiographic experiments demonstrated that the DNA made after glycerol induction was not evenly distributed among the microcysts. The distribution of grains per microcyst fits the following model of chromosome replication: in exponential phase, each daughter cell receives two chromosomes which are replicated sequentially during 80% of the divison cycle; after microcyst induction, no chromosomes are initiated. Mathematical formulas were derived which predict the kinetics and discrete probability distribution for several chromosome models.<Autoradiography, Bacteria, growth &amp; development, metabolism, Chromosomes, DNA, Bacterial, biosynthesis, Kinetics, Mathematics, Models, Theoretical, Tritium
16032515<Flagellated actinomycetes.<Shadowed motile elements from actinomycetes were observed with an electron microscope. Included were three strains of Actinoplanes, two of Ampullariella, two of Dermatophilus, two of Spirillospora, and four of "Nocardia" turbata. In addition, three types of previously undescribed actionmycetes were represented: (i) the C(4) group (four strains) forming substrate mycelium breaking into motile rods; (ii) strain 9-41, forming Microellobosporia-like sporangia with motile spores; and (iii) strain P(2), forming aerial hyphae releasing motile cocci when put in water. All the known chemical cell wall types of actinomycetes except the Nocardia asteroides type and the Actinomyces israeli type were represented in this array of motile actinomycetes. Motile elements were, depending on the genus, cocci, rods (often curved), or pyriform. Flagella were always in tufts (or single), never peritrichous. A relationship seems to exist between the location of the tuft and the cell wall composition. The spores of one strain of Actinoplanes were herniated, thus resembling plasmoptysis forms of bacteria.<Actinomycetales, cytology, Amino Acids, analysis, Carbohydrates, analysis, Cell Wall, analysis, Flagella, Microscopy, Electron, Nocardia, cytology, Pimelic Acids, analysis
16032516<Chemical composition of the cell walls of Bacillus stearothermophilus.<Cell walls were isolated by mechanical disruption of mid-log phase cells of Bacillus stearothermophilus NCA 1503-4R grown in Trypticase-yeast extract-fructose medium at 55 C. The cell walls were purified by treatment with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and incubation with deoxyribonuclease and trypsin. The cell wall peptidoglycan contained glucosamine, muramic acid, alpha, epsilon-diaminopimelic acid, and glutamic acid. Low amounts of glycine, galactosamine, serine, aspartic acid, lysine, and valine were also present. The relative mole ratios of glutamic acid-alpha, epsilon-diaminopimelic acid-glycine-alanine were 1.00:1.26:0.08:1.55. The cell walls were free from ribonucleic acid and deoxyribonucleic acid and contained less than 0.2% chloroform-methanol extractable lipid and 0.09 mumole of phosphorus per mg of cell wall. Teichoic acid was not detected in the cell walls of this organism. Cell walls isolated without treatment with SDS contained 7.5% chloroform-methanol extractable lipid, 0.24 mumole of phosphorus per mg of cell wall, and relatively high concentrations of all amino acids. These results suggest that the extracted lipid is not a cell wall component per se, but a contaminant from the lipoprotein cell membrane.<Amino Acids, analysis, Amino Sugars, analysis, Bacillus, analysis, Cell Wall, analysis, Lipids, analysis, Microscopy, Electron
16032519<Behavioral contrast and relative reinforcement frequency in two multiple schedules.<After preliminary variable-interval training, one group of pigeons was trained on a series of multiple variable-interval low-rate reinforcement schedules, while another group was trained on a series of multiple variable-interval fixed-ratio reinforcement schedules. Contrast effects were observed as variable-interval baseline rate changed in a direction away from the change in reinforcement frequency in the other component. The effects of the variable-interval component on performance in the low-rate and fixed-ratio reinforcement components in the multiple schedules were assessed by comparing the birds' performances on each of these schedules alone. Fixed-ratio reinforcement schedules showed a susceptibility to contrast effects, low-rate reinforcement schedules did not. The rate of reinforcement in fixed-ratio schedules at which no interaction occurred in the multiple schedules was higher than that in variable-interval 1-min schedules, suggesting that pigeons may prefer time-based, rather than response-based, reinforcement.<Animals, Birds, Conditioning, Psychological, Reaction Time, Reinforcement Schedule, Reinforcement, Psychology
16032520<Some temporal properties of behavioral contrast.<Pigeons were rewarded on a variable time interval for pecking a translucent key illuminated with either a 45 degrees or a vertical line. The key illumination changed every 2 min during daily 1-hr sessions. When the rates of pecking were stable, reinforcement was omitted in the presence of the 45 degrees line. Responding in the presence of the vertical line increased. This increase did not disappear when responses to the 45 degrees line were once more reinforced, but when reinforcements for responses in the presence of the 45 degrees line were again omitted, responding to the vertical line increased again. After the second alternation of these two procedures, the increased responding to the vertical line appeared when responses were not reinforced in the presence of the 45 degrees line, and disappeared when reinforcement was available during both stimuli. In a second experiment, the key illumination changed between sessions only, so that 1-hr sessions of reinforcement and non-reinforcement occurred on alternate days. Responding to the vertical line still increased when responding to the 45 degrees line was not reinforced, but the increase tended to disappear during the session.<Animals, Birds, Discrimination Learning, Extinction, Psychological, Lighting, Reinforcement Schedule, Reinforcement, Psychology
16032521<Response patterning during stimulus generalization in the rat.<Nine rats were trained to bar press in the presence of a clicking sound of 6.67 cps (S(D)) for 1-min variable-interval food reinforcement randomly alternated with a clicking sound of 20 cps (S(Delta)) signifying extinction. After a criterion of 90% of total responses in the presence of the S(D) was obtained, a generalization test was administered, including values of 6.67, 10.00, 13.33, and 20.00 cps, with responses in the presence of the S(D) continuing to be reinforced during testing. The test yielded a gradient of response strength with rate highest in the presence of the S(D) and decreasing with increasing distance from this value. An interresponse time (IRT) analysis of responding during generalization testing revealed no systematic differences in modal IRT category or in median IRT to the different test stimuli. Mean IRT was lowest in the presence of the S(D) and increased systematically with increasing distance from this value, supporting the hypothesis that the generalization gradient of response rate is primarily the result of an increasing proportion of "long" IRT responses to stimuli increasingly distant from the S(D).<Animals, Discrimination Learning, Extinction, Psychological, Female, Generalization, Psychological, Generalization, Stimulus, Rats, Reaction Time, Reinforcement, Psychology, Sound
16032522<An electromechanical analyzer using histogram techniques.<In behavioral studies it is often necessary to classify events and store the number of events occurring in each classification. The classification requirements may be either functions of amplitude (i.e., intensity, force, peaks, etc.) or time (i.e., duration, interval, etc.). The following describes an analyzer capable of classifying events according to their duration, interval, or time of occurrence, and storing and displaying the number of such events in each classification.<Behavior, Classification, Electronics, instrumentation, Psychology, instrumentation
16032524<Stimulus control of temporally spaced responding in second-order schedules.<Second-order schedules consisting of sequences of component differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate schedules were used to investigate two different methods of introducing exteroceptive stimuli. When different exteroceptive stimuli were associated with each component (chained schedule), periods of pausing and lower response rates developed in the early components compared to the early components of the same sequence in the presence of a single exteroceptive stimulus (tandem schedule). When a brief stimulus change occurred at the completion of each component, response rates were higher in the early components compared to the tandem schedule.

Three types of error were observed: alternating-bar switching before response requirements for reinforcement were met; perseverating-responding on the wrong bar after reinforcement; and overshooting-responding on a bar after reinforcement became available. Alternating and perseverating errors occurred mainly on the bar requiring the smaller ratio. When the ratios on the bars were changed, alternating errors were most common, but they diminished rapidly. Perseverating and overshooting errors did not diminish.<Animals, Conditioning, Operant, Conditioning, Psychological, Environment, Male, Rats, Reinforcement Schedule, Reinforcement, Psychology
16032527<Interhemispheric transfer of lever pressing as stimulus generalization of the effects of spreading depression.<Rats trained to lever-press with spreading depression in one cerebral hemisphere showed weak responding when tested with depression shifted to the trained hemisphere. The rats were then divided into two groups: one group (normal) was permitted a single reinforced response with neither hemisphere depressed, the other group (depressed) was permitted a single reinforced response with the trained hemisphere depressed; both groups were then tested with the trained hemisphere depressed. Responding during this second test increased for both groups, but the magnitude of the increase tended to be greater for the depressed than for the normal group. Since memory transfer could not have occurred with the trained hemisphere depressed, the results were taken to indicate that the single reinforced response strengthened stimulus generalization between train-test conditions.<Animals, Brain, physiology, Cortical Spreading Depression, physiology, Generalization, Psychological, Generalization, Stimulus, Male, Memory, Potassium Chloride, pharmacology, Psychophysiology, Rats, Reinforcement, Psychology, Transfer, Psychology
16032528<Control of schedule-induced polydipsia: type, size, and spacing of meals.<Rats were given daily 1-min variable-interval sessions for several types of food delivered in various amounts per reinforcement and the concurrent, schedule-induced polydipsia was measured. Dry, solid food was neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for the development of polydipsia. Small portions of liquid Standard Monkey Diet produced polydipsia, but 45-mg dextrose or sucrose pellets did not. Within the range studied, smaller portions of both solid and liquid foods produced more drinking than larger portions per reinforcement. Two-min variable-interval sessions produced a greater polydipsic response than 1-min variable-interval, even though the number of 45-mg Noyes pellets allowed per session was held constant. Polydipsia was greatly attenuated on these schedules when the number of pellets remained constant, but were delivered two at a time. Within the ranges studied, the concurrent polydipsic response was increased by decreasing the rate of food acquisition, either by using smaller portions of food per reinforcement or by increasing the interreinforcement time.<Animals, Female, Food, Rats, Reinforcement Schedule, Reinforcement, Psychology, Thirst
16032530<Classical conditioning of courting behavior in the Japanese quail, Coturnix coturnix japonica.<Male Japanese quail were classically conditioned to display courting behavior at the sound of a buzzer, a previously neutral stimulus. The buzzer (conditioned stimulus) was paired with the presentation of a female quail (unconditioned stimulus) for a number of trials. The courting display, invariably elicited from the male by the presentation of the female, began to appear in part to the conditioned stimulus as early as the fifth pairing. All components of the display were elicited from all birds by the conditioned stimulus alone within 32 pairings of the conditioned and unconditioned stimuli.<Animals, Behavior, Animal, Birds, Conditioning, Classical, Conditioning, Psychological, Courtship, Male, Sexual Behavior, Sound
16032531<Temporal patterns of sexual behavior in rabbits as determined by an automatic recording technique.<Sexual behavior between rabbits was automatically recorded by means of electrodes attached externally to the unrestrained animals. Current flowed only when the animals came into physical contact; the duration and amplitude of the current flow provided a means of automatic differentiation between sexual and other types of physical contact. Various temporal aspects of sexual behavior were revealed: (1) copulation was preceded by a series of thrusts that occurred at a constant frequency of 13 to 14 thrusts per sec; (2) the duration of a copulation was about 1.5 sec and could be as brief as 0.3 sec; (3) copulation was much more likely during the hours between dusk and dawn despite constant illumination; (4) copulations occurred in groups or "runs" characterized by many copulations within a few hours; (5) each run began with a high rate of copulation that often decreased over time; (6) between runs, several hours or days passed with little or no sexual activity; and (7) a run of copulations was noted at the end of every 16- to 20-day period (which corresponds to the known period of pseudopregnancy in rabbits) whether or not other runs occurred within this period.<Animals, Behavior, Animal, Female, Male, Psychology, Experimental, instrumentation, Rabbits, Sexual Behavior
16032971<Biosynthesis of ethylene. Formation of ethylene from methional by a cell-free enzyme system from cauliflower florets.<1. The formation of ethylene from cauliflower florets is stimulated by the addition of either methionine or its hydroxy analogue. 2. Formation of ethylene from these compounds may also be demonstrated in cell-free extracts, but the most rapid formation is achieved by the addition of methional. 3. Fractionation of such extracts has shown that both particulate and non-particulate fractions are necessary for the formation of ethylene from methionine or its hydroxy analogues, but only the non-particulate fraction is necessary for its formation from methional. 4. A study of this system has shown that the conversion of methional into ethylene requires the presence of two enzyme systems, the first generating peroxide and the second catalysing the conversion of methional into ethylene in the presence of peroxide. 5. The presence of a heat-stable factor in cauliflower extracts that is necessary for the full activity of the enzyme converting methional into ethylene has also been shown. 6. The nature of this factor is at the present unknown; it is not a metal nor is it identifiable with many of the known coenzymes.<Aldehydes, metabolism, Catalase, analysis, Chelating Agents, pharmacology, Ethylenes, biosynthesis, Flavins, pharmacology, Glucose Oxidase, analysis, Hydrogen Peroxide, pharmacology, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Methionine, metabolism, Peroxidases, analysis, Plants, Edible, enzymology
16032975<The oxidation of NN-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine by oxidizing agents and by caeruloplasmin.<1. The oxidation of NN-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine (DPD) by inorganic oxidants and by caeruloplasmin was studied. Some experiments were also made with NNN'N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TPD). 2. E(mM) (550) of the first free radical oxidation product of DPD (DPD(+)) was 9.8 and E(mM) (563) of the corresponding product of TPD (TPD(+)) was 12.5. 3. The non-enzymic decomposition of DPD(+) was studied with respect to temperature, pH, concentration and DPD/DPD(+) ratio, thus defining conditions for enzyme experiments under which DPD(+) extinction at 550mmu was proportional to enzyme activity. 4. Rates of oxidation of DPD to DPD(+) by caeruloplasmin were constant over a range of DPD concentrations. At low DPD concentrations a lag period occurred, which was eliminated by addition of DPD(+). 5. A lag period was not observed with TPD, but at low TPD concentrations the rate of TPD(+) formation was greater when TPD(+) was added. This suggests that TPD(+) may compete weakly as a substrate with TPD and may be oxidized further by the enzyme before a non-enzymic reaction with TPD to form more TPD(+). 6. With DPD sulphate or acetate or TPD sulphate as substrate, Lineweaver-Burk plots were curved. With DPD hydrochloride the chloride ion caused inhibition at higher concentrations, opposing the curvature. 7. Curved Lineweaver-Burk plots were interpreted in terms of two types of substrate binding site with different K(m) values but similar V(max.) values. 8. The apparent thermodynamic changes associated with enzyme-substrate-complex formation at the sites with higher K(m) suggest that considerable conformational change may occur on binding at these sites. 9. With substrate concentrations at which only the low-K(m) sites are involved 2mol. of DPD(+)/mol. of caeruloplasmin are formed before a steady state is established. At higher substrate concentrations up to 3.2mol. of DPD(+)/mol. of caeruloplasmin are formed at this initial stage. 10. Results are discussed in relation to caeruloplasmin structures in which (a) two valence-changing and two permanently cuprous copper atoms are more accessible than the remaining four copper atoms or (b) binding of substrate at one site hinders access of substrate to another site.<Aniline Compounds, Bromine, Ceruloplasmin, blood, Chemical Phenomena, Chemistry, Chloramines, Chromates, Copper, analysis, Ferricyanides, Humans, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Iodine, Kinetics, Oxidation-Reduction, Spectrophotometry
16032976<Effect of glucamylase on tissue glycogen and tissue glucamylase in the rat.<1. A fungal glucamylase (alpha-1,4-glucan glucohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.3) from Aspergillus niger depresses liver glycogen stores after intraperitoneal injection into the rat. The injected enzyme rapidly disappears (within about 8hr.) from the serum; less than 1% is excreted in the urine, but it is rapidly taken up in the liver, spleen, kidney, cardiac and skeletal muscle. Elevated glucamylase concentrations could be demonstrated in liver and spleen tissues for 1-4 days after injection, but in kidney, cardiac and skeletal muscle elevated glucamylase concentrations could be shown only for periods of less than 24hr. after injection of the enzyme.<Animals, Aspergillus, enzymology, Autoanalysis, Blood Glucose, metabolism, Buffers, Centrifugation, Female, Glycogen, metabolism, Glycoside Hydrolases, blood, metabolism, pharmacology, urine, Injections, Intraperitoneal, Kidney, enzymology, Liver, enzymology, Liver Glycogen, metabolism, Male, Muscles, enzymology, metabolism, Myocardium, enzymology, metabolism, Rats, Spleen, enzymology
16032977<Citrate content of liver and kidney of rat in various metabolic states and in fluoroacetate poisoning.<The citrate content of rat liver changes little when normal rats are starved, when starved rats are re-fed with various diets and when normal animals are made diabetic with alloxan. The citrate content of rat kidney changes little on starvation, but it doubles on induction of diabetes. Fluoroacetate poisoning has relatively little effect on the citrate content of liver under a variety of conditions except that normal female rats show a 2.4-fold increase. Fluoroacetate poisoning leads to increases in the citrate content of kidney under all conditions. The relevance of these observations to the regulation of fatty acid synthesis is discussed. The acetic anhydride-pyridine method and the pentabromoacetone method for the estimation of citrate are compared.<Animals, Citrates, analysis, metabolism, Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental, metabolism, Diet, Fatty Acids, biosynthesis, Female, Fluoroacetates, poisoning, Injections, Intraperitoneal, Kidney, metabolism, Liver, metabolism, Male, Rats, Sex, Spectrophotometry, Starvation, metabolism, Tissue Extracts
16032978<Comparison of oxidative metabolism in starved, fat-fed and carbohydrate-fed rats.<1. Rats were starved for 48hr. or fed for 1 week on a high-fat or a high-carbohydrate diet. The effects of these dietary alterations on the rate of production of (14)CO(2) from trace amounts of [U-(14)C]glucose, [1-(14)C]palmitate or [1-(14)C]acetate administered intravenously were studied. 2. The oxidation of [(14)C]glucose was most rapid in the carbohydrate-fed condition and was decreased significantly and to the same extent after starvation and after feeding with fat. 3. Under all dietary regimes studied the maximum rate of elimination of (14)CO(2) from [(14)C]palmitate occurred within a few minutes after injection, but considerably more was oxidized after starvation and feeding with fat than after feeding with carbohydrate. 4. Alterations in diet had no effect on the oxidation and high recovery of administered [(14)C]acetate as (14)CO(2). 5. Graphical analysis showed the presence of several exponential components in the (14)CO(2)-elimination curves. 6. In all studies a marked similarity in oxidative pattern was noted between the starved and the fat-fed rat.<Acetates, metabolism, Animals, Butter, Carbon Dioxide, metabolism, Carbon Isotopes, Dietary Carbohydrates, Dietary Fats, Glucose, metabolism, Injections, Intravenous, Kinetics, Palmitic Acids, metabolism, Rats, Starch, Starvation, metabolism
16032979<The action of semicarbazide on the aggregation of the tropocollagen macromolecule.<1. A difference in conformation was found between the collagen in solutions treated with semicarbazide hydrochloride and those treated with sodium chloride. This difference could be correlated with the difference in extent of aggregation between the fibrils precipitated from these solutions. 2. The action of semicarbazide hydrochloride depended on the pH and temperature of treatment in a complex manner. At constant temperature semicarbazide enhanced aggregation at pH values less than 4.3, but decreased aggregation was observed at pH values greater than 5.0. At pH 4.3 the effect of semicarbazide on aggregation varied with temperature, the tendency to increased aggregation being more pronounced at 34 degrees and 36-37 degrees . Similar increased aggregation tendencies superimposed on an overall decreased aggregation were observed at these temperatures at pH8.9. 3. A specific binding of semicarbazide to the collagen molecule was indicated.<Animals, Cattle, Chemical Phenomena, Chemistry, Collagen, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Semicarbazides, Skin, Sodium Chloride, Solubility, Spectrophotometry, Temperature
16032980<The binding of inhibitors to alpha-chymotrypsin at alkaline pH.<1. The binding of the competitive inhibitor N-acetyl-d-tryptophan amide to alpha-chymotrypsin has now been studied at pH values up to 10.6, by the technique of equilibrium dialysis. 2. This binding depends on the ionization of a group on the free enzyme with apparent pK(a) 9.3 at 5 degrees . 3. This group is tentatively identified as that responsible for an enzyme conformation change at high pH values, on which the catalytic activity of the enzyme also depends.<Amides, Chemical Phenomena, Chemistry, Chymotrypsin, Dialysis, Enzymes, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Kinetics, Protein Binding, Protein Denaturation, Thermodynamics, Tritium, Tryptophan

The interactions of the aflatoxins (B(1), G(1) and G(2)) with nucleosides result in difference spectra and suggest that the purine bases and the amino group play a role in the binding of all the aflatoxins to DNA.<Adenine, Aflatoxins, Amines, Animals, Cattle, Chemical Phenomena, Chemistry, Chromatography, Gel, DNA, Guanine, Nucleosides, Purines, Spectrophotometry, Temperature, Thymidine, Thymus Gland

The enzyme preparation was free from other related enzymes known to occur in sweet almonds, and behaved as a homogeneous protein on filtration through Sephadex G-75. 3. A molecular weight of about 33000 was determined from the gel-filtration data. 4. The ultraviolet-absorption spectrum and thermal inactivation of the enzyme are described. 5. The purified enzyme hydrolysed p-nitrophenyl alpha-d-galactoside at a much faster rate than melibiose. 6. The pH optimum was at 5.5-5.7. 7. Besides hydrolysis, it also catalysed transfer of galactosyl residues, chain elongation of melibiose and the synthesis of oligosaccharides from galactose.<Buffers, Centrifugation, Chemical Precipitation, Chromatography, Chromatography, Gel, Chromatography, Paper, Disaccharides, analysis, Galactose, Galactosidases, analysis, Glucose, Glycosides, analysis, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Kinetics, Molecular Weight, Nuts, Oligosaccharides, biosynthesis, Photometry, Solubility, Spectrophotometry, Temperature
16032984<The inhibition of accumulation of [1-14C]glycine and its incorporation into protein of Ehrlich ascites-carcinoma cells by DL-methionine.<1. By incubation of Ehrlich ascites-carcinoma cells in vitro with [1-(14)C]glycine the relation between the uptake of glycine and its incorporation into protein was examined. 2. With dl-methionine as a competitive inhibitor, there was not only a decrease in uptake of this amino acid, but also inhibition of its incorporation into protein. 3. It is only in its initial stage that the increase in incorporation is accompanied by increase in intracellular concentration of free glycine. Further increase in the amino acid pool has no effect on protein synthesis. 4. Even with a high cell concentration of glycine, methionine produces a decrease both in the uptake and its incorporation. This suggests that the inhibition of incorporation of glycine by methionine is due, not only to decrease in its intracellular concentration, but also to changes in other processes responsible for protein synthesis.<Animals, Carbon Isotopes, Carcinoma, Ehrlich Tumor, metabolism, Centrifugation, Chemical Precipitation, Culture Techniques, Glycine, analysis, metabolism, Kinetics, Methionine, pharmacology, Mice, Neoplasm Proteins, biosynthesis, Neoplasm Transplantation
16032985<Preparation, properties and metabolism of 5,6-monoepoxyretinoic acid.<1. Methyl retinoate has been converted into methyl 5,6-monoepoxyretinoate by reaction with monoperphthalic acid. The epoxy acid ester on alkaline hydrolysis gave 5,6-monoepoxyretinoic acid. 2. Treatment of the 5,6-monoepoxy compounds with ethanolic hydrochloric acid gave the corresponding 5,8-epoxy (furanoid) compounds. 3. With lithium aluminium hydride, the acid and the ester groups were selectively reduced to primary alcohols. 4. Administration of methyl 5,6-monoepoxyretinoate intraperitoneally and subcutaneously had good growth response in vitamin A-deficient rats. 5. 5,6-Monoepoxyretinoic acid, when given intraperitoneally as the sodium salt, was 157% as active as all-trans-retinyl acetate. 6. Methyl 5,6-monoepoxyretinoate was hydrolysed to the epoxy acid by rat-liver homogenate.

16032986<Metabolism and biological potency of retro-retinyl acetate in the rat.<1. retro-Retinyl acetate was shown to exert its biological activity by conversion into vitamin A. 2. When administered orally, retro-retinyl acetate was hydrolysed to retro-retinol in the intestine, isomerized to retinol and esterified before being transported to the liver for storage. 3. Administration of the compound at as high a dose as 4.0mg./day for 4 days led to the accumulation of both vitamin A and retro-vitamin A in the liver. The amount of retro-vitamin A in liver gradually decreased until it was almost completely converted into vitamin A in 18 days. 4. Intraperitoneal administration of the compound led to the accumulation of both vitamin A and retro-vitamin A in liver and other tissues. No vitamin A was detected in any tissue of rats receiving retro-retinyl acetate intraperitoneally after enterectomy. 5. The small intestine is the major site of conversion of retro-vitamin A into vitamin A. The conversion could also be demonstrated by everted intestinal sacs. 6. The biological potency of retro-retinyl acetate determined by the rat-growth assay was 20.5% that of all-trans-retinyl acetate, when given orally.<Acetates, metabolism, Animals, Biological Assay, Chemical Phenomena, Chemistry, Chromatography, Culture Techniques, Injections, Intraperitoneal, Intestines, analysis, Kidney, analysis, Liver, analysis, Lung, analysis, Male, Rats, Spectrophotometry, Spleen, analysis, Stomach, analysis, Tissue Extracts, Vitamin A, analysis, blood, metabolism, Vitamin A Deficiency, metabolism
16032987<Physiology of rat-liver polysomes. The stability of messenger ribonucleic acid and ribosomes.<Starvation of rats for several days led to marked decrease in cytoplasmic polysomes and accumulation of breakdown products having S values less than 200s. Re-feeding of the starved animals induced a rapid reassembly of polysomes. These newly formed polysomes, in the presence of actinomycin D, decayed in a biphasic fashion: about two-thirds decayed with an apparent half-life of 3-3(1/2)hr. but the other one-third were much more stable. Evidence that polysome decay is an accurate reflexion of messenger RNA stability is presented, and it is concluded that in the presence of large doses of actinomycin D, rat-liver cytoplasm contains messenger RNA classes of widely varying stability, the more stable class having a half-life of at least 80hr. The half-life of liver ribosomes was also determined and was found to be 110-127hr.<Animals, Carbon Isotopes, Centrifugation, Density Gradient, Chemical Precipitation, Chromosomes, Cytoplasm, analysis, Dactinomycin, pharmacology, Diet, Female, Injections, Intraperitoneal, Leucine, pharmacology, Liver, cytology, Orotic Acid, Protein Biosynthesis, RNA, Messenger, Rats, Ribosomes, Spectrophotometry, Starvation, Trichloroacetic Acid, Ultracentrifugation

Maize and barley shoots have been shown to contain phylloquinone, plastoquinone, alpha-tocopherol (and gamma-tocopherol in maize), alpha-tocopherolquinone and ubiquinone-9. 2. No solanesol was detected in any tissue examined. 3. In maize shoots plastoquinone and alpha-tocopherolquinone were localized in the chloroplast; ubiquinone was in the mitochondria. 4. Etiolated (dark-grown) shoots contained smaller amounts of phylloquinone and plastoquinone; alpha-tocopherolquinone was entirely absent; ubiquinone and alpha-tocopherol concentrations were unaffected. 5. On illumination of etiolated shoots the chloroplastidic quinones phylloquinone, plastoquinone and alpha-tocopherolquinone were synthesized in step with chloroplast development. alpha-Tocopherolquinone was not formed at the immediate expense of alpha-tocopherol.<Carotenoids, metabolism, Chlorophyll, metabolism, Chloroplasts, metabolism, Chromatography, Chromatography, Paper, Darkness, Edible Grain, metabolism, Light, Lipids, analysis, Mitochondria, metabolism, Plant Development, Quinones, metabolism, Spectrum Analysis, Terpenes, Ubiquinone, metabolism, Vitamin E, metabolism, Vitamin K 1, metabolism, Zea mays, metabolism
16033529<Intestinal triglyceride absorption in the rat. An electron microscopical study.<This report provides information on the morphology of fat absorption in rat intestinal epithelial cells. Three types of experiments were performed: (a) intubation of corn oil into fasted rats, (b) injection of physiological fatty-chyme prepared from fat-fed donor rats into ligated segments of jejunum of fasted animals, and (c) administration of electron-opaque particles in corn oil and markers given concurrently with the fat. These results support the hypothesis that fat is absorbed by selective diffusion of monoglycerides and fatty acids from micelles rather than by pinocytosis of unhydrolized triglycerides. Evidence is presented that the pits between the microvilli, previously believed to function in the transport of fat, are not involved in this process. Instead they appear to contribute their contents to lysosomes in the apical cytoplasm. Arguments are offered that the monoglycerides and fatty acids diffuse from the micelle while the latter is associated with the microvillous membrane of the absorptive cell. These micellar components penetrate the plasma membrane and diffuse into the cytoplasmic matrix where they encounter the SER. Triglyceride synthesis occurs in the SER and results in the deposition of fat droplets within its lumina. The synthesis of triglycerides and their sequestration into the SER establishes an inward diffusion gradient of monoglycerides and fatty acids.<Animals, Biological Transport, Dietary Fats, metabolism, Endoplasmic Reticulum, Fasting, Fats, metabolism, Fatty Acids, metabolism, Gastric Mucosa, cytology, Glycerides, metabolism, Golgi Apparatus, Histocytochemistry, Intestinal Absorption, physiology, Intestine, Small, cytology, Lysosomes, metabolism, Microscopy, Electron, Organoids, Pinocytosis, Rats, Triglycerides, biosynthesis, metabolism
16033530<Electron microscopic localization of acetylcholinesterase and nonspecific cholinesterase at the neuromuscular junction by the gold-thiocholine and gold-thiolacetic acid methods.<By means of the gold-thiocholine (AuThCh) and gold-thiolacetic acid (AuThAc) methods, it has been demonstrated electron microscopically that acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is located at the prejunctional axoplasmic membrane and the postjunctional sarcoplasmic membrane, including the full lengths of its invaginations, at the motor end plate of mouse intercostal muscle. Nonspecific cholinesterase (ChE) is present in relatively low concentrations at the same sites, and in greater concentrations in the teloglial Schwann sheath cells. Significant amounts of reaction product appeared in the junctional cleft only after prolonged incubation with both methods. The identification of AChE and ChE was confirmed by the use of appropriate concentrations of several selective inhibitors. In confirmation of previous studies by light microscopy, the AuThCh method is more specific for AChE and ChE, whereas the AuThAc method allows greater accuracy of localization.<Acetates, Acetylcholinesterase, metabolism, Animals, Choline, Cholinesterases, metabolism, Gold, Histocytochemistry, Mice, Microscopy, Electron, Neuromuscular Junction, enzymology, Schwann Cells, enzymology, Sulfhydryl Compounds
16033531<The biogenesis of mitochondria in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A comparison between cytoplasmic respiratory-deficient mutant yeast and chlormaphenicol-inhibited wild type cells.<The effects of chloramphenicol on S. cerevisiae and on a cytoplasmic respiratory-deficient mutant derived from the same strain are compared. In the normal yeast, high concentrations of chloramphenicol in the growth medium completely inhibit the formation of cytochromes a, a(3), b, and c(1) and partially inhibit succinate dehydrogenase formation, whereas they do not affect cytochrome c synthesis. This has been correlated with the marked reduction of mitochondrial cristae formation in the presence of the drug. In glucose-repressed normal yeast, chloramphenicol has little effect on the formation of outer mitochondrial membrane, or on the synthesis of malate dehydrogenase and fumarase. However, both these enzymes, as well as the number of mitochondrial profiles, are markedly decreased when glucose de-repressed yeast is grown in the presence of chloramphenicol. The antibiotic did not appear to affect the cytoplasmic respiratory-deficient mutant. The results have been interpreted to indicate that chloramphenicol inhibits the protein-synthesizing system characteristic of the mitochondria. Since the drug does not prevent the formation of cytochrome c, of several readily solubilized mitochondrial enzymes, or of outer mitochondrial membrane, it is suggested that these are synthesized by nonmitochondrial systems.<Chloramphenicol, pharmacology, Cytochromes, metabolism, Hydro-Lyases, metabolism, Malate Dehydrogenase, metabolism, Microscopy, Electron, Mitochondria, enzymology, Mutation, Oxygen Consumption, Saccharomyces, drug effects, Spectrophotometry
16033532<Fine structural localization of a blood-brain barrier to exogenous peroxidase.<Horseradish peroxidase was administered to mice by intravenous injection, and its distribution in cerebral cortex studied with a recently available technique for localizing peroxidase with the electron microscope. Brains were fixed by either immersion or vascular perfusion 10-60 min after administration of various doses of peroxidase. Exogenous peroxidase was localized in the lumina of blood vessels and in some micropinocytotic vesicles within endothelial cells; none was found beyond the vascular endothelium. Micropinocytotic vesicles were few in number and did not appear to transport peroxidase while tight junctions between endothelial cells were probably responsible for preventing its intercellular passage. Our findings therefore localize, at a fine structural level, a "barrier" to the passage of peroxidase at the endothelium of vessels in the cerebral cortex. The significance of these findings is discussed, particularly with reference to a recent study in which similar techniques were applied to capillaries in heart and skeletal muscle.<Animals, Blood-Brain Barrier, physiology, Cerebral Cortex, metabolism, Histocytochemistry, Mice, Microscopy, Electron, Peroxidases, pharmacology, Pinocytosis

Latex beads 1.305, 1.90, and 2.68 micro in diameter are ingested individually, with each bead tightly surrounded by a membrane derived from the plasma membrane. Latex beads 0.557, 0.264, 0.126, and 0.088 micro in diameter are accumulated at the surface of the ameba and then phagocytosed, with many beads tightly packed within one membrane-bounded vesicle.<Animals, Cell Membrane, physiology, Eukaryota, physiology, Latex, Microscopy, Electron, Microspheres, Phagocytosis, physiology, Polystyrenes, Polyvinyls
16033534<Fine structure of the asexual stages of Plasmodium elongatum.<Plasmodium elongatum, an avian malarial parasite, differs from other such parasites by infecting both the circulating red blood cells and the hematopoietic cells. The exoerythrocytic development of P. elongatum occurs mainly in these red cell precursors. The fine structure of the asexual stages of P. elongatum has been studied in the bone marrow and peripheral blood of canaries and compared with that of the asexual stages of other avian malarial parasites. With minor differences, the merozoites of P. elongatum possess the same organelles as those in the exoerythrocytic merozoites of P. fallax and the erythrocytic stages of P. cathemerium, P. lophurae, P. fallax, and P. gallinaceum. The developmental sequence is also essentially similar to that of other avian malarial parasites, in that upon entry into a new host cell, the dedifferentiation, growth, and redifferentiation phases take place. However, we have found some important differences in the feeding mechanism of P. elongatum. The cytostome is involved in the ingestion of host cell cytoplasm in both exoerythrocytic and erythrocytic stages, in contrast to P. fallax, in which the cytostome is inactive in the exoerythrocytic stages. In P. elongatum, host cell cytoplasm is ingested through the cytostome, and "boluses" are formed and incorporated into a large digestive vacuole. Subsequently, the digestion of the boluses takes place in this digestive vacuole. Thus, in regard to the function of the cytostome, the exoerythrocytic stages of P. elongatum appear to be closely related to the erythrocytic stage which has a feeding mechanism similar to that of the erythrocytic stage of other avian malarial parasites.<Animals, Hematopoietic System, microbiology, Malaria, Avian, pathology, Microscopy, Electron, Plasmodium, growth &amp; development
16033535<Lipid synthesis, intracellular transport, and secretion. II. Electron microscopic radioautographic study of the mouse lactating mammary gland.<In the mammary glands of lactating albino mice injected intravenously with 9, 10-oleic acid-(3)H or 9, 10-palmitic acid-(3)H, it has been shown that the labeled fatty acids are incorporated into mammary gland glycerides. The labeled lipid in the mammary gland 1 min after injection was in esterified form (&gt; 95%), and the radioautographic reaction was seen over the rough endoplasmic reticulum and over lipid droplets, both intracellular and intraluminal. At 10-60 min after injection, the silver grains were concentrated predominantly over lipid droplets. There was no concentration of radioactivity over the granules in the Golgi apparatus, at any time interval studied. These findings were interpreted to indicate that after esterification of the fatty acid into glycerides in the rough endoplasmic reticulum an in situ aggregation of lipid occurs, with acquisition of droplet form. The release of the lipid into the lumen proceeds directly and not through the Golgi apparatus, in contradistinction to the mode of secretion of casein in the mammary gland or of lipoprotein in the liver. The presence of strands of endoplasmic reticulum attached to intraluminal lipid droplets provides a structural counterpart to the milk microsomes described in ruminant milk.<Animals, Autoradiography, Biological Transport, physiology, Endoplasmic Reticulum, metabolism, Fatty Acids, metabolism, Female, Glycerides, metabolism, Golgi Apparatus, metabolism, Histocytochemistry, Lactation, physiology, Leucine, metabolism, Lipids, biosynthesis, Mammary Glands, Animal, cytology, metabolism, Mice, Microscopy, Electron, Oleic Acids, metabolism, Palmitic Acids, metabolism, Pregnancy, Tritium
16033536<Cartilage resorption in the tibial epiphyseal plate of growing rats.<An electron microscopic study of the tibial epiphyseal plates of growing rats reveals that the resorption of unmineralized and mineralized cartilage occurs by two different mechanisms. During resorption the unmineralized transverse cartilaginous walls between chondrocytes are invaded by capillary sprouts. At the resorption zone, numerous cytoplasmic processes derived primarily from the perivascular cells and, to a lesser extent, from the endothelial cells of the sprouts penetrate and appear to lyse the unmineralized transverse cartilaginous walls. Hydrolases released from the degenerating chondrocytes and/or capillary sprouts may also participate in this process. The second resorption mechanism involves the mineralized longitudinal cartilaginous septa. Resorption of these septa is mediated by chondroclasts whose fine structure is identical with that of osteoclasts. The active surface of the chondroclasts has a ruffled border. The surface membrane of the chondroclasts is relatively smooth on either side of the ruffled border and lies in direct apposition with the underlying mineralized cartilage. This observation suggests that the microenvironment in the zone of resorption may be maintained by the neighboring unruffled surfaces of the chondroclasts, which thus seal off and segregate the active portions of these cells.<Animals, Cartilage, Articular, growth &amp; development, Epiphyses, growth &amp; development, Microscopy, Electron, Rats, Tibia, growth &amp; development
16033537<Studies of the mitochondrial energy-transfer system of brown adipose tissue.<An investigation of the mechanisms of norepinephrine action and heat production in brown adipose tissue from newborn rabbits has been carried out. Data obtained with the use of biochemical techniques has been correlated with morphological data from electron microscopy. Norepinephrine was found to stimulate the respiration of brown fat in vitro. Inhibitors of glycolysis abolish this effect, whereas inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation do not, at least not to the same extent. Brown fat is readily permeable to added Krebs cycle intermediates. Substrate level phosphorylation, but no electron transport-coupled phosphorylation, could be demonstrated in isolated mitochondria. It is suggested that the rate of fatty acid oxidation is limited by the availability of phosphate acceptor systems which break down ATP formed at the substrate level and thus provide ADP for further substrate level phosphorylation. The theory of respiratory control by the action of reesterification of fatty acids is discussed in the light of these findings. Under the electron microscope, brown fat mitochondria are characterized by their large size, tightly packed cristae, and by the different types of granules in the matrix. No elementary particles are seen when the mitochondria are examined by the negative-staining technique. The absence of electron transport-coupled phosphorylation together with the apparent absence of elementary particles seems to be of particular significance.<Adenine Nucleotides, metabolism, Adenosine Triphosphate, metabolism, Adipose Tissue, metabolism, Animals, Animals, Newborn, Biophysical Phenomena, Biophysics, Body Temperature, Energy Transfer, Fatty Acids, metabolism, Microscopy, Electron, Mitochondria, metabolism, Norepinephrine, physiology, Oxidative Phosphorylation, Oxygen Consumption, Rabbits, Rats
16033538<The transformation of the Plasmodium gallinaceum oocyst in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.<Sporoblast and sporozoite formation from oocysts of the avian malarial parasite, Plasmodium gallinaceum, after the seventh day of infection in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes offers an interesting example of differentiation involving the appearance and modification of several cellular components. Sporoblast formation is preceded by (a) invaginations of the oocyst capsule into the oocyst cytoplasm, (b) subcapsular vacuolization and cleft formation, (c) the appearance of small tufts of capsule material on the previously noted invaginations, and (d) linear dense areas located just below the oocyst plasma membrane which predetermine the site of emerging sporozoites from the sporoblast. The subcapsular clefts subdivide the once-solid oocyst into sporoblast peninsulae. Within the sporoblast, nuclei migrate from the random distribution seen in the solid oocyst and come to lie at the periphery of the sporoblast just below the linear dense areas noted in the earlier stage. A typical nuclear fiber apparatus occurs in most of the nuclei seen in random sections at this stage although such a fiber apparatus may occasionally be seen in the solid oocyst stage. The nucleus, its associated fiber apparatus, and the overlying dense area appear to induce the onset of sporozoite budding from the sporoblast as well as the formation of the sporozoite pellicular complex and the paired organelle precursor. Several mitochondria are present in each sporozoite, in contrast to the single mitochondrion seen in the merozoites of the erythrocytic and exoerythrocytic stages of avian malaria infection. The paired organelles and associated dense inclusion bodies are formed by condensation of an irregular meshwork of membrane-bound, coarse, dense material. The nature of small, particulate cytoplasmic inclusions is described.<Aedes, Animals, Malaria, Avian, pathology, Microscopy, Electron, Plasmodium, growth &amp; development
16033539<Studies on the microtubules in heliozoa. II. The effect of low temperature on these structures in the formation and maintenance of the axopodia.<When specimens of Actinosphaerium nucleofilum are placed at 4 degrees C, the axopodia retract and the birefringent core (axoneme) of each axopodium disappears. In fixed specimens, it has been shown that this structure consists of a highly patterned bundle of microtubules, each 220 A in diameter; during cold treatment these microtubules disappear and do not reform until the organisms are removed to room temperature. Within a few minutes after returning the specimens to room temperature, the axonemes reappear and the axopodia begin to reform reaching normal length 30-45 min later. In thin sections of cells fixed during the early stages of this recovery period, microtubules, organized in the pattern of the untreated specimens, are found in each reforming axopodium. Reforming axopodia without birefringent axonemes (and thus without microtubules) are never encountered. From these observations we conclude that the microtubules may be instrumental not only in the maintenance of the axopodia but also in their growth. Thus, if the microtubules are destroyed, the axopodia should retract and not reform until these tubular units are reassembled. During the cold treatment short segments of a 340-A tubule appeared; when the organisms were removed from the cold, these tubular segments disappeared. It seems probable that they are one of the disintegration products of the microtubules. A model is presented of our interpretation of how a 220-A microtubule transforms into a 340-A tubule and what this means in terms of the substructure of the untreated microtubules.<Animals, Cold Temperature, Cytoplasm, Eukaryota, cytology, Microscopy, Electron, Models, Theoretical, Organoids
16033540<Flagellar regeneration in protozoan flagellates.<The flagella of populations of three protozoan species (Ochromonas, Euglena, and Astasia) were amputated and allowed to regenerate. The kinetics of regeneration in all species were characterized by a lag phase during which there was no apparent flagellar elongation; this phase was followed by elongation at a rate which constantly decelerated as the original length was regained. Inhibition by cycloheximide applied at the time of flagellar amputation showed that flagellar regeneration was dependent upon de novo protein synthesis. This was supported by evidence showing that a greater amount of leucine was incorporated into the proteins of regenerating than nonregenerating flagella. The degree of inhibition of flagellar elongation observed with cycloheximide depended on how soon after flagellar amputation it was applied: when applied to cells immediately following amputation, elongation was almost completely inhibited, but its application at various times thereafter permitted considerable elongation to occur prior to complete inhibition of flagellar elongation. Hence, a sufficient number of precursors were synthesized and accumulated prior to addition of cycloheximide so that their assembly (elongation) could occur for a time under conditions in which protein synthesis had been inhibited. Evidence that the site of this assembly may be at the tip of the elongating flagellum was obtained from radioautographic studies in which the flagella of Ochromonas were permitted to regenerate part way in the absence of labeled leucine and to complete their regeneration in the presence of the isotope. Possible mechanisms which may be operating to control flagellar regeneration are discussed in light of these and other observations.<Amino Acids, metabolism, Animals, Autoradiography, Cycloheximide, pharmacology, Euglena, growth &amp; development, Eukaryota, growth &amp; development, Flagella, growth &amp; development, Leucine, metabolism, Protein Biosynthesis, Regeneration, physiology, Tritium
16033541<Chromosome pulverization in human binucleate cells following colcemid treatment.<Under the influence of Colcemid, a substantial number of binucleate human cells from a line infected with herpes-like virus was found to possess pulverized chromosomes. Although this abnormality was also detected in untreated binucleate cells, the increase in the number of pulverized cells after the addition of Colcemid was too striking to be explained by accumulation of spontaneously occurring cells in response to the mitotic inhibition by Colcemid. Furthermore, the induction of pulverization may be dependent upon Colcemid concentration. These findings imply an involvement of Colcemid in the mechanism of pulverization induction in the system studied. When tritiated thymidine was added to the culture medium simultaneously with Colcemid, the majority of binucleate cells with an intact and a pulverized chromosome set incorporated this isotope into the pulverized set only. This obviously suggests that the nuclei in the binucleate cell are asynchronous in DNA synthesis, and that this asynchrony is intimately related to the induction of the pulverization phenomenon. It seems very probable that the late S phase in the late synthesizing nuclei represents a critical stage at which damage to the chromosomes most readily occurs.<Autoradiography, Cell Division, drug effects, Cell Nucleus, drug effects, Chromosomes, drug effects, metabolism, Colchicine, pharmacology, DNA, biosynthesis, Female, Humans, Middle Aged, Thymidine, metabolism, Tritium
16033542<A morphological study of Halobacterium halobium and its lysis in media of low salt concentration.<The reported absence of a cell wall in halobacteria cannot be confirmed. Improved fixation techniques clearly show a cell wall-like structure on the surface of these cells. A stepwise reduction of the salt concentration causes the release of cell wall material before the cell membrane begins to disintegrate. The cell membrane breaks up into fragments of variable but rather small size, which are clearly different from a 4S component reported by others to be the major breakdown product of the cell membrane. It appears more likely that the 4S component arises from the dissolution of the cell wall. A residue of large membranous sheets remains even after prolonged exposure of halobacteria envelopes to distilled water. The lipids in these sheets do not differ significantly from the lipids in the lysed part of the cell membrane. The sheets, however, contain a purple-colored substance, which is not present in the lysed part. The easily sedimentable residue that remains after lysis of the cells or envelopes in distilled water also contains "intracytoplasmic membranes" with unusual structural characteristics. They can also be identified in sections through intact bacteria or envelope preparations. Their function is at present unknown but seems to be related to the formation of gas vacuoles in these organisms.<Bacteriolysis, Cell Membrane, Cell Wall, Chromatography, Thin Layer, Halobacterium, cytology, Microscopy, Electron, Sodium Chloride, pharmacology
16033545<A heat-sensitive cellular function located in the nucleolus.<Striking nucleolar lesions occur in cultured cells after exposure to supranormal temperatures. These lesions appear at 42 degrees C and consist of a loss of the granular ribonucleoprotein (RNP) component and intranucleolar chromatin, and a disappearance of the nucleolar reticulum. The material remaining in the morphologically homogeneous nucleolus is a large amount of closely packed fibrillar RNP. The lesions remain identical as temperature increases to 45 degrees C. These alterations are reversible when the cells are returned to 37 degrees C and are associated with the reappearance of an exaggerated amount of intranucleolar chromatin and granular RNP. High-resolution radioautography indicates that after thermic shock nucleolar RNA synthesis is inhibited whereas extranucleolar sites are preserved: it also suggests that the granular RNP is reconverted to fibrillar RNP probably by simple unraveling. The results prove the existence of heat-sensitive cellular functions in the nucleolus which deal with the DNA-dependent RNA synthesis. The precise site of action is assumed to involve hydrogen bonds, resulting in configurational changes in nucleolar RNP and affecting the stability of the DNA molecule. The subsequent events in nucleolar RNA synthesis are discussed in light of the morphologic and biochemical effects of actinomycin D on the nucleolus.<Animals, Autoradiography, Cell Nucleolus, physiology, Cricetinae, Culture Techniques, DNA, metabolism, Endoplasmic Reticulum, Histocytochemistry, Hot Temperature, Microscopy, Electron, Nucleoproteins, metabolism, RNA, biosynthesis, Tritium, Uridine, metabolism
16033546<DNA-protein binding in interphase chromosomes.<The metachromatic dye, azure B, was analyzed by microspectrophotometry when bound to DNA fibers and DNA in nuclei with condensed and dispersed chromatin. The interaction of DNA and protein was inferred from the amount of metachromasy (increased beta/alpha-peak) of azure B that resulted after specific removal of various protein fractions. Dye bound to DNA-histone fibers and frog liver nuclei fixed by freeze-methanol substitution shows orthochromatic, blue-green staining under specific staining conditions, while metachromasy (blue or purple color) results from staining DNA fibers without histone or tissue nuclei after protein removal. The dispersed chromatin of hepatocytes was compared to the condensed chromatin of erythrocytes to see whether there were differences in DNA-protein binding in "active" and "inactive" nuclei. Extraction of histones with 0.02 N HCl, acidified alcohol, perchloric acid, and trypsin digestion all resulted in increased dye binding. The amount of metachromasy varied, however; removal of "lysine-rich" histone (extractable with 0.02 N HCl) caused a blue color, and a purplish-red color (micro-peak absorption) resulted from prolonged trypsin digestion. In all cases, the condensed and the dispersed chromatin behaved in the same way, indicating the similarity of protein bound to DNA in condensed and dispersed chromatin. The results appear to indicate that "lysine-rich" histone is bound to adjacent anionic sites of a DNA molecule and that nonhistone protein is located between adjacent DNA molecules in both condensed and dispersed chromatin.<Animals, Anura, Cell Division, Cell Nucleus, metabolism, Coloring Agents, DNA, metabolism, Erythrocytes, metabolism, Histones, metabolism, Liver, metabolism, Protein Binding, Proteins, metabolism, Spectrophotometry, Trypsin, metabolism
16033547<Ascorbic acid deficiency in cultured human fibroblasts.<Fibroblasts grown in medium containing less than 1 microg of ascorbic acid per milliliter showed evidence of ascorbic acid deficiency when compared with cells grown in medium containing 50 microg of ascorbic acid per milliliter. This was manifested morphologically by dilated endoplasmic reticulum, a decrease in number, size, and intensity of staining of the mitochondria, by defective intercellular fibril formation, and by easy disaggregation of the cells from the intercellular matrix after treatment with pronase. When 50 microg per milliliter of ascorbic acid was incorporated into the medium, the altered morphology was corrected, banded fibrils were produced which were organized into bundles, and the cells were tightly bound in a matrix which was resistant to disaggregation with a variety of proteolytic enzymes. Collagen and sulfated glycosaminoglycan synthesis were less in the control than in the ascorbic acid supplemented cells. Similar morphological and chemical changes have been reported in the connective tissue of scorbutic animals. The effects of low ascorbic acid concentration on fibroblasts in culture indicate that these cells require ascorbic acid to maintain connective tissue functions.<Amino Sugars, metabolism, Ascorbic Acid, metabolism, Ascorbic Acid Deficiency, metabolism, Collagen, metabolism, Connective Tissue, metabolism, Connective Tissue Cells, Culture Techniques, Endoplasmic Reticulum, Fibroblasts, cytology, metabolism, Histocytochemistry, Humans, Hydroxyproline, metabolism, Microscopy, Electron, Mitochondria
16033548<The time of synthesis and the conservation of mitosis-related proteins in cultured human amnion cells.<p-Fluorophenylalanine (PFPA), an analogue of phenylalanine which may be incorporated into proteins, increases the duration of mitosis. In the present experiments, based upon quantitative analyses of time-lapse cinemicrographic films, brief treatments of cells with PFPA are shown to affect the duration of metaphase in only those cells which enter division during or shortly after treatment. The offspring of cells with prolonged metaphases also tend to have prolonged metaphases. Analyses of the kinetics of the appearance of prolonged metaphases indicate that some protein specifically associated with mitosis is synthesized primarily during a period which corresponds closely to G(2). The manner in which the defect is passed on to daughter cells indicates that the protein involved is conserved and reutilized by daughter cells for their subsequent divisions. Comparable experiments performed with low concentrations of puromycin indicate that the major effect of PFPA is due to its incorporation into protein rather than its ability to inhibit protein synthesis. The fact that puromycin-induced effects can also be passed on to daughter cells is interpreted to mean that cells make only specific amounts of some mitosis-associated proteins and that if a cell "inherits" a deficiency in such protein it is not able to compensate for the deficiency.<Amnion, metabolism, Cell Division, drug effects, Culture Techniques, Humans, Motion Pictures, Phenylalanine, metabolism, pharmacology, Protein Biosynthesis, Puromycin, pharmacology
16033554<Effects of conditioned reinforcement frequency in an intermittent free-feeding situation.<Key-pecking intermittently produced a set of brief exteroceptive stimulus changes under two-component multiple schedules of conditioned reinforcement. Throughout the study, free access to grain was concurrently provided on an intermittent basis via a variable-interval tape. Free food presentations scheduled by the tape were delivered if no peck had been emitted for 6 sec, and the brief stimulus changes produced by responding under the multiple schedules were those which accompanied food presentation. The second component of each multiple schedule was always associated with a 1-min, variable-interval schedule of conditioned reinforcement. The schedule associated with the first component was systematically varied and conditioned reinforcement was either absent (extinction) or programmed on a 1-, 3-, 6-, or 12-min variable-interval schedule. Under these conditions, rate of responding in the manipulated component decreased monotonically with a decrease in the frequency of conditioned reinforcement. In addition, contrast effects were often obtained in the constant, second component. These results are similar to those obtained with similar multiple schedules of primary reinforcement.<Animals, Behavior, Animal, Birds, Conditioning, Psychological, Food, Male, Reinforcement, Psychology
16033555<Some effects of fixed-interval duration on response rate in a two-component chain schedule.<In Exp. I three pigeons were trained on a two-component chain schedule. Responding on a 1-min variable-interval schedule in the initial component led to a sequence of two fixed-interval schedules in the terminal component. The rate of reinforcement in the terminal component was kept constant while the values of the two fixed intervals were varied. Three combinations of fixed-interval schedules were studied, FI 0.25, FI 1.75 (minutes) or FI 1.00, FI 1.00, or FI 1.75, FI 0.25. The rate for each subject declined in the initial component as the value of the first fixed interval was increased. Experiment II was conducted to assess the role of the second fixed-interval schedule in the terminal component in determining the rate of responding in the initial component. For each chain schedule the rate of responding in the initial component was determined both with and without the second of the sequence of fixed intervals. In all three cases the rate of responding in the initial component decreased when the second fixed interval was removed. Increasing the first fixed interval in Exp. I had a greater effect on variable-interval performance than did the removal of the second fixed interval in Exp. II.<Animals, Behavior, Animal, Birds, Food, Reinforcement, Psychology, Time
16033556<Attention and temporal discrimination: factors controlling responding under a cyclic-interval schedule.<Pigeons were exposed to a cyclic schedule in which each cycle was composed of twelve 1-min fixed intervals followed by four 3-min fixed intervals; four such cycles comprised an experimental session. The pigeons responded at a much higher average rate during the 3-min intervals than during the 1-min intervals. Other effects were a depression of responding during the first short interval of each cycle and a shortening of postreinforcement pause during the second short interval. The main effect is attributable to a relatively fixed pattern of responding after reinforcement; this pattern consisted in a pause of approximately constant duration followed by responding at an approximately constant rate until the next reinforcement, resulting in much higher average response rates during the longer interreinforcement intervals. The other effects seem attributable to relatively slight differences between the pattern of responding characteristic of later long intervals and the pattern during later short intervals of each cycle. A major implication is that the pigeon is largely insensitive to the sequential properties of many interval-reinforcement schedules. A description of interval-schedule "frustration" phenomena in terms of the inhibitory effects of reinforcement is discussed in relation to these results.<Animals, Attention, Behavior, Animal, Birds, Male, Reinforcement, Psychology, Time Perception
16033557<A peak shift on a line-tilt continuum.<Pigeons were trained to discriminate the presence or absence of a vertical line, and their performance on a subsequent generalization test was compared with that of other pigeons trained to discriminate a vertical from a 45 degrees line. On the generalization gradient after discrimination training, the presence/absence discrimination group showed a peak at 0 degrees (vertical) while the peak for the 0 degrees /45 degrees discrimination group shifted from 0 degrees in a direction away from the 45 degrees line. The results, discussed in connection with a recent suggestion about the role of color in the peak-shift effect, are interpreted as supporting the generality of the phenomenon.<Animals, Behavior, Animal, Birds, Learning, Visual Perception
16033560<Social facilitation of responses during a stimulus paired with electric shock.<Key-pecking responses of a pigeon were maintained by a variable-interval schedule of food reinforcement. The responses were suppressed during the occasional presentation of a warning stimulus paired with electric shock. The presence of a second pigeon emitting the same response for food reinforcement reduced the suppression that otherwise occurred during the warning stimulus when the second pigeon was absent. These results reveal that the social facilitation phenomenon can be used to restore behavior that is suppressed by a conditioned aversive stimulus.<Animals, Behavior, Animal, Birds, Electroshock, Food, Reinforcement, Psychology, Time
16033576<Depolarization of the internal membrane system in the activation of frog skeletal muscle.<"Skinned" muscle fibers, single fibers from the frog semitendinosus muscle in which the sarcolemma had been removed, could be reversibly activated by electrical stimulation. Electrical responsiveness was abolished when the skinned fiber was prepared from a muscle exposed to a cardiac glycoside, and the development of responsiveness was delayed when the muscle was bathed in high potassium solution. The findings were taken as evidence that active sodium-potassium exchange across the internal membranes restored electrical excitability, after the sarcolemma had been removed, by establishing a potential gradient across the internal membranes. In general, the contractions were graded with the strength of the applied current. On occasion, however, "all-or-none" type responses were seen, raising the possibility that the internal membranes were capable of an electrically regenerative response. Activation could also be produced by an elevation of the intracellular chloride ion concentration or a decrease in the intracellular potassium, ion concentration, suggesting that depolarization of some element of the internal membrane system, that is, a decrease in the potential of the lumen of the internal membrane system relative to the potential of the myofibrillar space, was responsible for activation in these experiments. The distribution of both the electrically induced contractions and those produced by changes in the intracellular ion concentrations indicated that the responsive element of the internal membrane system was electrically continuous over many sarcomeres.<Animals, Anura, Biological Transport, Active, Cell Membrane Permeability, Chlorides, pharmacology, Electric Stimulation, Electrophysiology, Membrane Potentials, Muscle Contraction, physiology, Muscles, cytology, Myofibrils, physiology, Potassium, metabolism, pharmacology, Sodium, metabolism, Strophanthins, pharmacology
16033577<Validity of the force-velocity relation for muscle contraction in the length region, l less than or equal to l-o.<Considerable attention has been directed to the characteristic force-velocity relation discovered by A. V. Hill in the study of muscle kinematics. Models of contractile process were tested on the basis of their compatibility with the Hill equation. However, almost all the isotonic data have been restricted to one length, l(0), the maximum length with almost no resting tension; the velocities measured are those initial values when the load begins to move. The force-velocity curve extrapolates to zero velocity for isometric tension, but only for the tension at that one length. Very few efforts have been made to study the profiles of the curves throughout the range of lengths over which shortening takes place. In examining the length region, l &lt;/= l(0), for an isotonically contracting muscle, not only is the force-velocity relation valid for the initial reference length, l(0), but also for any other length. The analysis in this report indicates that the constants a/P(0) and b/l(0) remain fixed throughout the length change of afterloaded isotonic shortening in the Rana pipiens sartorius muscles.<Animals, Anura, Kinetics, Mathematics, Muscle Contraction, physiology, Physical Phenomena, Physics
16033578<Theoretical series elastic element length in Rana pipiens sartorius muscles.<Assuming a two component system for the muscle, a series elastic element and a contractile component, the analyses of the isotonic and isometric data points were related to obtain the series elastic stiffness, dP/dl(s), from the relation, See PDF for Equation From the isometric data, dP/dt was obtained and shortening velocity, v, was a result of the isotonic experiments. Substituting (P(0) - P)/T for dP/dt and (P(0) - P)/(P + a) times b for v, dP/dl(s) = (P + a) /bT, where P &lt; P(0), and a, b are constants for any lengths l &lt;/= l(0) (Matsumoto, 1965). If the isometric tension and the shortening velocity are recorded for a given muscle length, l(0), although the series elastic, l(s), and the contractile component, l(c), are changing, the total muscle length, l(0) remains fixed and therefore the time constant, T. Integrating, See PDF for Equation the stress-strain relation for the series elastic element, See PDF for Equation is obtained; l(sc0) - l(s) + l(c0)where l(co) equals the contractile component length for a muscle exerting a tension of P(0). For a given P/P(0), l(s) is uniquely determined and must be the same whether on the isotonic or isometric length-tension-time curve. In fact, a locus on one surface curve can be associated with the corresponding locus on the other.<Animals, Anura, Biophysical Phenomena, Biophysics, Elastic Tissue, physiology, Mathematics, Muscle Contraction, physiology, Stress, Physiological
16033579<Acetylcholine and calcium on membrane permeability and contraction of intestinal smooth muscle.<Acetylcholine elicited a sustained contraction and an increase in potassium efflux in longitudinal muscle isolated from the guinea pig ileum. Stepwise increases in the calcium concentration of the bathing medium, from 0.06 to 36 mM generally reduced the increase in potassium efflux, but had a complex effect on the mechanical response. Contractions produced by high levels of acetylcholine became progressively larger or remained at a high magnitude as the calcium concentration was increased. Contractions produced by low levels of acetylcholine also improved initially, but were depressed again by the highest concentration of calcium introduced. Ethanol, in the appropriate concentration, inhibited completely the acetylcholine-induced contraction without reducing the increase in potassium efflux. Calcium reversed this effect. Both extracellular calcium and ethanol depressed the large, transient increase in muscle tone developed by fibers that were preincubated in a high calcium medium and then exposed to a calcium-free medium. These findings suggested that extracellular calcium ions react with two different sites in the membrane, a stabilizing site and a storage site. A muscle contraction is activated by calcium ions which diffuse from the storage site to the myoplasm. Calcium ions reacting with the stabilizing site impede this diffusion process. Part of the stimulatory effect of acetylcholine is derived from its capacity to counteract the action of calcium at the stabilizing site.<Acetylcholine, pharmacology, Animals, Biological Transport, Active, Calcium, pharmacology, Cell Membrane Permeability, drug effects, Ethanol, pharmacology, Guinea Pigs, Ileum, physiology, Muscle Contraction, drug effects, Muscle, Smooth, physiology, Potassium, metabolism, physiology, Potassium Isotopes
16033580<Small intestinal glucose transport. Proximal-distal kinetic gradients.<Proximal and distal small intestinal segments of the rat were perfused in situ at two different rates with isotonic solutions containing glucose in concentrations ranging from 25 to 600 mg/100 ml. Absorption was measured as glucose disappearance rate from the lumen. Glucose absorption had not previously been studied at intraluminal concentrations above and below blood glucose. Absorption was more rapid from the proximal segment. In both segments absorption was independent of perfusion rate and of whether glucose was analyzed by counting (14)C or by the Somogyi method. The latter finding suggests that of the unidirectional fluxes, flux out of the bowel is much greater than flux into the bowel. In contrast to the findings in previous studies neither segment showed rate-limiting kinetics, and the Michaelis-Menten analysis was not applicable. The form of the curve depicting absorption rate in relation to concentration differed between the two segments. At the higher concentrations absorption rate continued to increase much more rapidly in the proximal than in the distal segment. The observations could not be explained by known mechanisms of glucose transport and illustrate the difficulties of achieving biochemically and physiologically meaningful in vivo studies of intestinal absorption.<Animals, Biological Transport, Blood Glucose, Carbon Isotopes, Glucose, metabolism, Intestinal Absorption, Intestine, Small, metabolism, Isotonic Solutions, Kinetics, Male, Mathematics, Rats
16033581<Two different ionic mechanisms generating the spike "positive" afterpotential in molluscan neurons.<The ionic bases of the "positive" afterpotential (ap) have been examined in the so-called DInhi neurons of the central nervous system of Cryptomphallus aspersa. In these cells E(K) has been determined and its value compared with the equilibrium, potential of the ap (E(ap)). It has been found that in half of the studied cells the E(K) value is very close to E(ap) whereas in another half, the difference (E(K) - E(ap)) is large and amounts to circa -10 mv. The effects of changes in the concentration gradients of K(+), Cl(-), and Na(+) were assayed in both groups of cells. When the [K(i)/[K](o) ratio is reduced in both groups of neurons, the ap amplitude and the E(ap) diminished. In cells displaying a large (E(K) - E(ap)), Cl-free Ringer's solution diminished the ap amplitude and E(ap), but produced no effect in the neurons with a reduced (E(K) - E(ap)). A similar effect was observed if [Cl], was increased by intracellular injection of NaCl. Changes in both [Na](o) and [Na](i) were ineffective. It is concluded that K(+) is the only ion involved in the origin of the ap in the groups of cells with a low value for (E(K) - E(ap)). On the contrary, the ap of the neurons presenting large (E(K) - E(ap)) is produced by a simultaneous increase in the fluxes of both K(+) and Cl(-).<Action Potentials, Animals, Central Nervous System, physiology, Chlorides, metabolism, Electrophysiology, Membrane Potentials, Neurons, physiology, Potassium, metabolism, Snails, Sodium, metabolism, Sodium Chloride, pharmacology
16033582<Resolution of pump and leak components of sodium and potassium ion transport in human erythrocytes.<Further support for the pump-leak concept was obtained. Net transport was resolved into pump and leak components with the cardiac glycoside, ouabain. The specificity of ouabain as a pump inhibitor was demonstrated by its ineffectiveness when the pump was already inhibited by lack of one of the three pump substrates, sodium ion, potassium ion, or adenosine triphosphate. In the presence of ouabain the rates of passive transport of sodium and potassium ions changed almost in proportion to changes in their extracellular concentrations when one ion was exchanged for the other. In the presence of ouabain and at the extracellular concentrations which produced zero net transport, the ratio of potassium ions to sodium ions was 1.2-fold higher inside the cells than outside. This finding was attributed to a residual pump activity of less than 2% of capacity. The permeability to potassium ions was 10% greater than the permeability to sodium ions. A test was made of the independence of pump and leak. Conditions were chosen to change the rate through each pathway separately or in combination. When both pathways were active, net transport was the sum of the rates observed when each acted separately. A ratio of three sodium ions pumped outward per two potassium ions pumped inward was confirmed.<Adenosine Triphosphate, metabolism, Biological Transport, Cell Membrane Permeability, Erythrocytes, metabolism, Humans, Mathematics, Ouabain, pharmacology, Potassium, metabolism, Sodium, metabolism, Water-Electrolyte Balance
16033583<Sodium exchange in dog ventricular muscle. Relation to frequency of contraction and its possible role in the control of myocardial contractility.<Sodium exchange was studied in the arterially perfused papillary muscle of the dog. Three kinetically defined phases accounted for all the myocardial sodium: phase 0 (vascular)-lambda(o) (exchange constant) = 3.6 min(-1) phase 1 (interstitial)-lambda(1) = 0.62 min(-1); phase 2 (intracellular)-lambda(2) &lt; 0.020 min(-1) in quiescent muscles. The phase 2 exchange rate was proportional to frequency of contraction and increased by approximately 0.004 min(-1) for each 1 beat/min increment in rate in muscles demonstrating stable function. A sudden increase in frequency of contraction was followed by a marked increase in phase 2 sodium exchange if muscle function did not deteriorate. This increased exchange required 14 min to achieve a steady state. During this time active tension increased (positive staircase) and then declined to become stable as the sodium exchange stabilized. In muscles in which increased frequency of contraction produced a progressive decrease in active tension and contracture, sodium exchange failed to increase. The characteristics of sodium exchange are compared to those previously defined for calcium and potassium in the perfused dog papillary muscle. It is proposed that alteration in sodium exchange is a primary determinant of calcium and potassium movements and thereby plays a significant role in the control of myocardial contractility.<Animals, Biological Transport, Calcium, metabolism, Dogs, Heart Ventricles, metabolism, Kinetics, Muscle Contraction, Myocardium, metabolism, Papillary Muscles, metabolism, Potassium, metabolism, Sodium, metabolism, Sodium Isotopes
16033584<Alanine and sodium fluxes across mucosal border of rabbit ileum.<Unidirectional influxes of L-alanine and Na from the mucosal solution into the epithelium of in vitro rabbit ileum have been determined. In the presence of 140 mM Na, alanine influx is approximately 2.2 micromoles/hr cm(2), but is inhibited if the NaCl in the mucosal solution is replaced by choline Cl, Tris-Cl, mannitol, LiCl, or KCl. Although alanine influx is strongly dependent upon Na in the mucosal solution, it is uninfluenced by marked reduction of intracellular Na pools. In addition, alanine influx is unaffected by intracellular alanine concentration. Na influx is markedly inhibited by the presence of Li. Evidence is presented that Na transport across the mucosal border cannot be attributed to simple diffusion even though the net flux across this surface is in the direction of the electrochemical potential difference.<Alanine, metabolism, Animals, Biological Transport, Active, Carbon Isotopes, Choline, pharmacology, Female, Ileum, metabolism, In Vitro Techniques, Intestinal Mucosa, metabolism, Lithium, pharmacology, Male, Mannitol, pharmacology, Membrane Potentials, Potassium Chloride, pharmacology, Rabbits, Sodium, metabolism, Sodium Chloride, pharmacology, Sodium Isotopes, Tritium, Tromethamine, pharmacology
16033585<Kinetic relations of the Na-amino acid interaction at the mucosal border of intestine.<The relation between unidirectional influxes of Na and amino acids across the mucosal border of rabbit ileum was studied under a variety of conditions. At constant Na concentration in the mucosal bathing solution, amino acid influx followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics permitting determination of maximal influx and the apparent Michaelis constant, K(t). Reduction in Na concentration, using choline as substitute cation, caused an increase in K(t) for alanine but had no effect on maximal alanine influx. The reciprocal of K(t) was a linear function of Na concentration. Similar results were obtained for valine and leucine and these amino acids competitively inhibited alanine influx both in the presence and in the absence of Na. These results lead to a model for the transport system which involves combination of Na and amino acid with a single carrier or site leading to penetration of both solutes. The model predicts that alanine should cause an increase in Na influx and the ratio of this extra Na flux to alanine flux should vary with Na concentration. The observed relation agreed closely with predicted values for Na concentrations from 5 to 140 mM. These results support the hypothesis that interactions between Na and amino acid transport depend in part on a common entry mechanism at the mucosal border of the intestine.<Alanine, metabolism, Amino Acids, metabolism, Animals, Biological Transport, Active, Cell Membrane Permeability, Choline, pharmacology, Female, Ileum, metabolism, Intestinal Mucosa, metabolism, Kinetics, Leucine, metabolism, Male, Models, Theoretical, Rabbits, Sodium, metabolism, Temperature, Valine, metabolism
16033586<The selective inhibition of delayed potassium currents in nerve by tetraethylammonium ion.<The effect of tetraethylammonium ion (TEA) on the voltage clamp currents of nodes of Ranvier of frog myelinated nerve fibers is studied. The delayed K currents can be totally abolished by TEA without affecting the transient Na currents or the leakage current in any way. Both inward and outward currents disappear. In low TEA concentrations small K currents remain with normal time constants. The dose-response relationship suggests the formation of a complex between TEA and a receptor with a dissociation constant of 0.4 mM. Other symmetrical quaternary ammonium ions have very little effect. There is no competition between TEA and agents that affect the Na currents such as Xylocaine, tetrodotoxin, or Ca ions. The pharmacological data demonstrate that the Na, K, and leakage permeabilities are chemically independent, probably because their mechanisms occupy different sites on the nodal membrane.

16033587<Binding of Ca ions by Paramecium caudatum.<Binding of (45)Ca by live Paramecium caudatum was determined under various external ionic conditions. It was found that calcium uptake was separable into at least two components, a rapid and a slow one. The rapid component was influenced by the presence of certain other ions in a manner which agrees with the law of mass action. It appears that an ion exchange system may be involved in a binding equilibrium established between Paramecium, Ca(++), and certain other ions. K(+), Rb(+), and Ba(++) in the equilibrium medium are among those ions which inhibit calcium uptake. It is proposed that liberation of Ca(++) from binding sites on Paramecium by an exchange reaction with competing ions is the first step in the mechanism of ciliary reversal in the response to external application of these ions.<Animals, Barium, metabolism, Calcium, metabolism, Calcium Isotopes, Cell Membrane Permeability, Cilia, metabolism, Kinetics, Magnesium, metabolism, Paramecium, metabolism, Potassium, metabolism, Rubidium, metabolism, Water-Electrolyte Balance
16033588<Nonsolvent water in human erythrocytes.<From the ability of a concentrated suspension of human erythrocytes to regulate the pH of unbuffered, anisotonic, external media it is possible to calculate the fractional cell volume in which chloride is dissolved. The difference between this volume and the total cell water gives the nonsolvent water (for chloride) of the cell. Nonsolvent water is less than 3% of the isotonic cell volume. The quantity of nonsolvent water per cell may increase as the cells shrink in hypertonic solutions.<Buffers, Chlorides, analysis, Erythrocytes, analysis, Humans, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Hypertonic Solutions, Hypotonic Solutions, Isotonic Solutions, Mathematics, Osmosis, Water
16033589<Effects of ATP on the interaction of Ca++, Mg++, and K+ with fragmented sarcoplasmic reticulum isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle.<Fragmented sarcoplasmic reticulum isolated from skeletal muscle of the rabbit has a cation-binding capacity of about 350 microeq/g of protein at neutral pH. The same binding sites bind Ca, Mg, K, and H ions and, consequently, the selective binding of Ca induced by ATP releases an amount of the other cations equivalent to the Ca taken up. At pH values below 6.2, an increasing number of binding sites are associated with H(+), and ATP induces exchange of Ca mostly for H(+). At pH values above 6.2, the binding sites exist in the form of Mg and K, and Ca is bound in exchange for these cations. The total bound Ca + Mg + K, expressed in microequivalents of cations bound per gram of protein, is approximately constant at various pCa values, which indicates a stoichiometric exchange of Ca for the other cations. To accomplish the same degree of exchange of Ca for other cations bound, in the absence of ATP, concentrations of free Ca(++) of about 1000-fold higher than those needed in the presence of ATP are required in the medium. We cannot distinguish between a mechanism whereby Ca actively transported into a compartment of the microsomal vesicles containing also the binding sites is bound passively to these sites in exchange for Mg, K, and H and another in which ATP selectively increases the affinity of surface-binding sites for Ca. Irrespective of the mechanism of accumulation, the Ca retained does not contribute to the activity of the cation in the membrane fraction. Caffeine (10 mM) has no effect on the binding of Ca, but releases a more labile fraction of Ca, which presumably accumulates in excess of the bound Ca. Procaine (5 mM) antagonizes the effect of caffeine. Acetylcholine and epinephrine have no effect on the binding of Ca.<Acetylcholine, pharmacology, Adenosine Triphosphate, pharmacology, Animals, Biological Transport, Active, Caffeine, pharmacology, Calcium, metabolism, Endoplasmic Reticulum, metabolism, Epinephrine, pharmacology, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Lipid Metabolism, Magnesium, metabolism, Microsomes, metabolism, Muscle Proteins, metabolism, Muscles, metabolism, Phospholipids, metabolism, Potassium, metabolism, Procaine, pharmacology, Rabbits
16033590<NMR evidence for complexing of Na+ in muscle, kidney, and brain, and by actomyosin. The relation of cellular complexing of Na+ to water structure and to transport kinetics.<The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum of Na(+) is suitable for qualitative and quantitative analysis of Na(+) in tissues. The width of the NMR spectrum is dependent upon the environment surrounding the individual Na(+) ion. NMR spectra of fresh muscle compared with spectra of the same samples after ashing show that approximately 70% of total muscle Na(+) gives no detectable NMR spectrum. This is probably due to complexation of Na(+) with macromolecules, which causes the NMR spectrum to be broadened beyond detection. A similar effect has been observed when Na(+) interacts with ion exchange resin. NMR also indicates that about 60% of Na(+) of kidney and brain is complexed. Destruction of cell structure of muscle by homogenization little alters the per cent complexing of Na(+). NMR studies show that Na(+) is complexed by actomyosin, which may be the molecular site of complexation of some Na(+) in muscle. The same studies indicate that the solubility of Na(+) in the interstitial water of actomyosin gel is markedly reduced compared with its solubility in liquid water, which suggests that the water in the gel is organized into an icelike state by the nearby actomyosin molecules. If a major fraction of intracellular Na(+) exists in a complexed state, then major revisions in most theoretical treatments of equilibria, diffusion, and transport of cellular Na(+) become appropriate.<Animals, Anura, Biological Transport, Brain, metabolism, Cell Membrane Permeability, Chemical Phenomena, Chemical Precipitation, Chemistry, Freezing, Ion Exchange Resins, Kidney, metabolism, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Muscle Proteins, metabolism, Muscles, metabolism, Sodium, metabolism, Water-Electrolyte Balance
16033591<The effect of the unstirred layer on human red cell water permeability.<A study has been made of water entry into human red blood cells under an osmotic pressure gradient. The measurements were made using a rapid reaction stop flow apparatus, whose construction, calibration, and performance are described in detail. Red cell volume changes were determined from 90 degrees scattered light. The permeability coefficient for water entry under a relative isosmolar concentration of 1 to 1.5 was found to be 0.22 +/- 0.01 cm(4)/sec osmol, which agrees well with our previously published value. The experiments were also designed to measure the thickness of the unstirred layer around the6 red cells. This was found to be 5.5 +/- 0.8 micro under the present experimental conditions. It is concluded that our previously measured permeability coefficient for water entrance under a diffusion gradient does not require correction on account of the unstirred layer.<Biological Transport, Cell Membrane Permeability, Erythrocytes, metabolism, physiology, Female, Humans, Male, Osmosis, Physiology, instrumentation, Water
16033592<Basis of tetrodotoxin's selectivity in blockage of squid axons.<The blockage of nerve activity by tetrodotoxin is unusually potent and specific. Our experiments were designed to distinguish whether its specificity of action was based on the identification of ions, the direction of cation flow, or differences in the early transient and late steady conductance pathways. Alkali cations were substituted for sodium in the sea water, bathing an "artificial node" in a voltage-clamped squid axon. When tetrodotoxin was added to the artificial sea waters at a concentration of 100 to 150 mM, it was found to always block the flow of cations through the early transient channel, both inward and outward, but it never blocked the flow of ions using the late steady pathway. We conclude that the selectivity of tetrodotoxin is based on some difference in these two channels.<Animals, Axons, drug effects, Biological Transport, Cell Membrane, Cesium, pharmacology, Electrophysiology, Lithium, pharmacology, Mollusca, metabolism, Neural Conduction, drug effects, Potassium, pharmacology, Rubidium, pharmacology, Sodium, pharmacology, Tetrodotoxin, pharmacology, Toxins, Biological, pharmacology
16033593<Comparison of tetrodotoxin and procaine in internally perfused squid giant axons.<Squid giant axons were internally perfused with tetrodotoxin and procaine, and excitability and electrical properties were studied by means of current-clamp and sucrose-gap voltage-clamp methods. Internally perfused tetrodotoxin was virtually without effect on the resting potential, the action potential, the early transient membrane ionic current, and the late steady-state membrane ionic current even at very high concentrations (1,000-10,000 nM) for a long period of time (up to 36 min). Externally applied tetrodotoxin at a concentration of 100 nM blocked the action potential and the early transient current in 2-3 min. Internally perfused procaine at concentrations of 1-10 mM reversibly depressed or blocked the action potential with an accompanying hyperpolarization of 2-4 mv, and inhibited both the early transient and late steady-state currents to the same extent. The time to peak early transient current was increased. The present results and the insolubility of tetrodotoxin in lipids have led to the conclusion that the gate controlling the flow of sodium ions through channels is located on the outer surface of the nerve membrane.<Action Potentials, drug effects, Animals, Axons, drug effects, Cell Membrane Permeability, Electrophysiology, Membrane Potentials, drug effects, Mollusca, Neural Conduction, drug effects, Potassium, metabolism, Procaine, pharmacology, Sodium, metabolism, Tetrodotoxin, pharmacology, Toxins, Biological, pharmacology
16033594<Determination of extracellular space in amphibian muscle.<The volumes of distribution of inulin and dextran in the sartorius, stomach, and cardiac muscle of the frog agree rather closely. That these spaces represent the volume of extracellular water is supported by the observation that efflux of sucrose can be divided into a fast and a slow phase and that the fast-moving fraction corresponds closely with inulin space determined in the same muscle. These and other findings confirm that sugars and related substances penetrate slowly into part of the fiber water and that, therefore, their volume of distribution does not accurately represent the volume of extracellular water. The kinetics of efflux of sucrose is consistent with the assumption that the movement of sugars is determined by the resistance of the cell surface as well as by internal diffusion. In connective tissue, sucrose and inulin are excluded only from a small part of the total water.<Animals, Anura, Carbon Isotopes, Cell Membrane Permeability, Connective Tissue, metabolism, Dextrans, metabolism, Extracellular Space, Gastric Mucosa, metabolism, Inulin, metabolism, Iodine Isotopes, Muscles, metabolism, Myocardium, metabolism, Osmosis, Pyrrolidinones, metabolism, Serum Albumin, metabolism, Sucrose, metabolism, Water
16033595<Separation of neutral glycosphingolipids and sulfatides by thin-layer chromatography.<Two one-dimensional systems for separation of glycolipids from total lipid extracts of tissues by thin-layer chromatography are described. System I used, as adsorbent, an alkaline mixture of silica gel without CaSO(4) binder (75%) and magnesium silicate (25%), and the lipids were "developed" with three successive solvent mixtures. The separated compounds (from the fastest to the slowest moving) were: ceramide, ceramide monohexosides, sulfatides, ceramide dihexosides, psychosine, ceramide trihexosides, and ceramide N-acetylhexosamine trihexosides. In system II a two-step development was used on an adsorbent consisting of silica gel without CaSO(4) binder (80%) and magnesium silicate (20%). The separated compounds were: ceramides, ceramide monohexosides, and ceramide dihexosides. Psychosine and sulfatides as well as ceramide trihexosides and ceramide N-acetylhexosamine trihexosides were not separated. In both systems all neutral lipids moved to the very top of the chromatogram and phospholipids stayed at the origin. Application of systems I and II for separation of glycolipids was demonstrated on total lipid extracts from animal tissues.<Cerebrosides, analysis, Chromatography, Thin Layer, Glycolipids, analysis, Phospholipids, analysis, Solvents
16033596<Occurrence of positional isomers of octadecenoic and hexadecenoic acids in human depot fat.<Positional isomers of hexadecenoic aud octadecenoic acids of human adipose tissue have been separated by gas-liquid chromatography and their amounts determined by oxidative cleavage (MnO(4) and IO(4)). The following isomeric octadecenoic acids were present: 7-octadecenoic acid (0.4%), 8- (1.9%), 9- (73.0%), 10- (2.5%), 11- (19.0%) and 12- (3.2%). The hexadecenoic acids have also been shown to be a mixture of positional isomers, in which the cis-9-isomer predominates. 10-Hexadecenoic and 12-octadecenoic acids could conceivably be precursors of linoleic acid. The following branched fatty acids have also been determined in human depot fat: 13-methyltetradecanoic, 12-methyltetradecanoic, 14-methylpentadecanoic, 14-methylhexadecanoic, and 16-methylheptadecanoic acid. They were present in percentages of 0.02-0.6% and their identification rests solely on comparison of their gas-liquid chromatographic retention times with those of synthetic compounds.<Adipose Tissue, analysis, Aged, Chemical Phenomena, Chemistry, Chromatography, Gas, Fatty Acids, analysis, Female, Humans, Oxidation-Reduction
16033597<Lipid composition of the vascular system during infancy, childhood, and young adulthood.<The object of this study was to determine the changes in lipid composition that occur in blood vessels from infancy to young adulthood. Analyses included levels of total cholesterol, total triglyceride, phospholipid, and cholesteryl ester fatty acids, and the distribution of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Triglyceride, total and monoenoic fatty acids, and linoleic acid were lower in the ascending, thoracic, and abdominal aorta than in the pulmonary artery and inferior vena cava. Phospholipids and arachidonic acid were higher in aortic segments than in the other two vessels. Aortic lipids showed significant changes with increasing age: total cholesterol and total fatty acids decreased from &lt;1 wk to 5 yr, then increased to 22 yr of age. Triglycerides decreased whereas cholesteryl esters increased from 10 to 22 yr of age. Saturated fatty acids decreased from 1 wk to 10 yr, then remained relatively constant. Linoleic acid (3.7-9.8% of total fatty acids) and arachidonic acid (15.8-21.7%) both increased with age; the increase in cholesteryl linoleate was highly significant. After 10 yr of age, total cholesterol and total fatty acids were significantly higher in abdominal than in ascending and thoracic segments of aorta.<Adolescent, Adult, Aging, Aorta, analysis, Child, Child, Preschool, Cholesterol, analysis, Fatty Acids, analysis, Female, Glycerides, analysis, Humans, Infant, Infant, Newborn, Lipids, analysis, Male, Phospholipids, analysis, Pulmonary Artery, analysis, Triglycerides, analysis, Vena Cava, Inferior, analysis
16033598<Distribution of radioactive glycerol and fatty acids among adipose tissue triglycerides after administration of glucose-U-14C.<Adipose lipid obtained from fed rats 15 or 60 min after injection of radioactive glucose was separated into 10 triglyceride classes of differing fatty acid compositions. The distribution among these classes of total and radioactive triglyceride-glycerol was determined and found to be the same. Thus newly synthesized adipose triglycerides resemble in kind and proportion the triglycerides which exist in the tissue. This finding is in accord with the concept that the structures of adipose triglycerides are stable over long periods and that the turnover rate of the several triglyceride species are similar. After administration of radioactive glucose, the specific activity of saturated fatty acids was higher in the more saturated triglyceride species. These data indicate that newly formed saturated acids do not mix completely with all adipose tissue fatty acids available for esterification. Fatty acids derived from plasma triglyceride influenced the composition of newly synthesized adipose tissue triglyceride and thus constitute an important source of adipose tissue lipid.<Adipose Tissue, analysis, Animals, Carbon Isotopes, Chromatography, Thin Layer, Dietary Fats, pharmacology, Fatty Acids, analysis, Glucose, metabolism, Glycerides, analysis, Glycerol, analysis, Male, Rats, Triglycerides, analysis
16033599<Incorporation of acetate into fatty acids and lecithin by lung slices from fetal and newborn lambs.<Incorporation of acetate-1-(14)C into phospholipids and fatty acids by lung slices from fetal and newborn lambs and from ewes was studied in vitro. The distribution of radioactivity in the fatty acids of neutral lipids, phospholipids, and lecithin was determined. Acetate-1-(14)C was incorporated into myristic, palmitic, and C(18) fatty acids. Of the lecithin fatty acids, myristic and palmitic were the major radioactive fatty acids. The results indicate that the lung of fetal lambs is able to synthesize lecithin containing saturated fatty acids, a major constituent of pulmonary surfactant. A marked increase in the rate of acetate incorporation into lecithin was observed during maturation, and these rates were higher than those obtained in the ewes. A possible relationship between developmental changes in lecithin biosynthesis and pulmonary surfactant is discussed.<Acetates, metabolism, Aging, Animals, Animals, Newborn, metabolism, Carbon Isotopes, Chromatography, Fatty Acids, biosynthesis, Fetus, metabolism, In Vitro Techniques, Lipids, analysis, Lung, metabolism, Phosphatidylcholines, biosynthesis, Phospholipids, analysis, Sheep
16033600<Changes in fatty acid composition of sulfolipid and phospholipids during maturation of alfalfa.<Lipids were extracted from alfalfa samples collected at intervals over the growing season and were fractionated to yield pure sulfolipid. In the sulfolipid and in a phospholipid fraction the major fatty acids were palmitic, linolenic, and linoleic, of which the palmitic acid increased in proportion during the season while the proportion of linolenic acid dropped. The sulfolipid contained more linolenic acid and less palmitic and linoleic acids than the phospholipids, and had a greater rate of change of fatty acid composition.<Chromatography, Fatty Acids, analysis, Linoleic Acids, analysis, Lipids, analysis, Medicago sativa, analysis, growth &amp; development, Palmitic Acids, analysis, Phospholipids, analysis, Spectrum Analysis, Sulfur, analysis
16033601<Direct gas chromatographic examination of total lipid extracts.<The conditions for gas-liquid chromatography described in a previous publication for the improved separation of natural triglycerides have been further modified to permit a direct examination of total lipid extracts. For this purpose the range of temperature programming has been extended to 100-350 degrees C. Under optimum conditions, complete separations and quantitative estimates are obtained for free fatty acids, free sterols, diglycerides, steryl esters, and triglycerides. The separations are based on differences in molecular weights. Glycero-phosphatides present in the sample seem to be pyrolyzed to compounds with retention times similar to those of diglycerides. The accuracy of the method is examined for standard mixtures of neutral lipids and fatty acids, and applications are illustrated with samples of the total plasma lipids of man. The lipid compositions obtained are compared with those data derived by conventional analyses. Although the method is rapid, its successful application to quantitative routine analyses requires extreme care.<Cholesterol, blood, Chromatography, Gas, instrumentation, Fatty Acids, blood, Glycerides, blood, Hot Temperature, Humans, Lipids, analysis, Molecular Weight, Phosphatidylcholines, blood, Triglycerides, blood
16033602<Metabolism of lysophosphatidyl ethanolamine and lysophosphatidyl choline by homogenates of rabbit polymorphonuclear leukocytes and alveolar macrophages.<A comparison has been made between the conversion of (32)P-labeled lysophosphatidyl ethanolamine (LPE) and lysophosphatidyl choline (LPC) to their respective acylated and deacylated derivatives by homogenates of rabbit polymorphonuclear leukocytes and alveolar macrophages. Synthesis of PE by both homogenates and of PC by macrophage homogenates proceeded to about the same extent and is attributed to direct acylation of the lyso compounds. At higher LPC concentrations formation of PC by leukocytes is far greater than by macrophages. The mechanism of this enhanced synthesis of PC, which is brought out by higher substrate concentrations, is believed to be a transfer of the acyl group of one LPC molecule to another. Under optimal conditions macrophage homogenates deacylated LPE to a greater extent than LPC, while the reverse was true for leukocyte homogenates. Albumin inhibited deacylation of LPC and its conversion to PC by leukocytes, perhaps by binding the substrate (2 moles of LPC per mole of albumin). Other effects of albumin-stimulation of deacylation and acylation of LPE by macrophages, inhibition of deacylation and acylation of LPE by leukocytes-remain unexplained.<Albumins, pharmacology, Animals, In Vitro Techniques, Leukocytes, metabolism, Lung, cytology, Lysophosphatidylcholines, metabolism, Macrophages, metabolism, Phosphatidylethanolamines, metabolism, Phosphorus Isotopes, Rabbits
16033603<Kinetic analysis of the oxidation of palmitate-1-14C in man during prolonged heavy muscular exercise.<Two healthy men with high working capacities were injected intravenously with palmitate-1-(14)C and NaH(14)CO(3) on two occasions while they were performing strenuous exercise on a bicycle ergometer. From analysis of (14)CO(2) in expired air after injection of NaH(14)CO(3), rate constants and compartment sizes describing a three-compartment system for CO(2) were determined algebraically. These data were combined with those of a separate study in which (14)C in free fatty acids of arterial blood plasma and in expired CO(2) were measured after injection of palmitate-1-(14)C to construct an eight-compartment model with an analogue computer that described precisely the observed data in each subject. The results indicate that under these conditions almost half of the free fatty acids leaving the blood are oxidized directly (i.e., are transferred to mitochondrial oxidative sites through small intermediate compartments). The remainder enters larger compartments apart from the direct pathway; most of this fraction reenters the direct oxidative pathway within 30 min. These observations suggest that certain esterified fatty acids contained in working muscle cells are rapidly renewed. Recycling of (14)C in plasma free fatty acids and triglyceride fatty acids was substantially reduced during exercise. Values for turnover rate and extent of oxidation of free fatty acids obtained by the method of continuous intravenous infusion of palmitate-1-(14)C were similar during exercise in these two subjects to those obtained after pulse injection.<Adult, Carbon Dioxide, metabolism, Carbon Isotopes, Fatty Acids, blood, Humans, Injections, Intravenous, Kinetics, Male, Models, Theoretical, Muscles, metabolism, Oxidation-Reduction, Palmitic Acids, metabolism, Physical Exertion
16033604<Composition of neutral lipids from erythrocytes of common mammals.<The neutral lipids of the erythrocytes were investigated in several common mammals: cow, dog, goat, horse, pig, rabbit, rat, and sheep. Cholesterol content was determined by gas-liquid, thin-layer, and column chromatography, the last in conjunction with the IR spectrophotometry. The three methods yielded similar results. In every species investigated, cholesterol was the major neutral lipid; cholesteryl esters, triglycerides, and free fatty acids were detected only in trace amounts. It is concluded that these substances may have been contaminants from plasma lipoproteins or leukocytes rather than true constituents of the erythrocyte. In the erythrocytes of all species, cholesterol content was close to 30% of the total lipids extracted from the cells, and the molar ratio of cholesterol to phospholipid was approximately one. The significance of the data is discussed in relation to current concepts of the structure of the cell membrane involving cholesterol-polar lipid complexes.<Animals, Cattle, Cell Membrane, analysis, Cholesterol, analysis, Chromatography, Dogs, Erythrocytes, analysis, Fatty Acids, analysis, Goats, Horses, Lipids, analysis, Phosphorus, analysis, Rabbits, Rats, Sheep, Spectrum Analysis, Swine, Triglycerides, analysis
16033605<Synthesis of fatty aldehydes and their cyclic acetals (new derivatives for the analysis of plasmalogens).<Saturated and unsaturated fatty aldehydes were prepared in good yield by the reduction of acid chlorides with lithium aluminum tri-t-butoxy hydride. Saturated odd and even numbered aldehydes were prepared by the ozonolysis-reduction of 1-alkenes. Ozonides were hydrogenated with a Lindlar catalyst or reduced with dimethyl sulfide. Several diols, including 1,3-propanediol and ethylene glycol, were used to synthesize cyclic acetals from aldehydes and plasmalogens in quantitative yield. Cyclic acetals were synthesized from 2,4-dinitrophenyl hydrazones when an exchanger such as acetone or acetylacetone was included in the reaction mixture. A number of physical and chemical properties indicate that cyclic acetals are stable compounds which do not decompose during storage or gas-liquid chromatographic (GLC) analysis. The cyclic acetals have unusually long retention volumes which are probably related to the large dipole moments found with cyclic compounds. These derivatives are, therefore, readily separated from their aldehyde and methyl ester analogues on polar and nonpolar stationary phases. GLC analysis of the aldehydogenic moieties in plasmologens may be conveniently carried out by direct conversion to cyclic acetals without preliminary isolation of aldehydes or removal of methyl esters by saponification.<Aldehydes, Chemical Phenomena, Chemistry, Chemistry, Organic, Chromatography, Organic Chemistry Phenomena, Plasmalogens, analysis, Spectrum Analysis

The ratio was satisfactorily preserved in cholesterol recovered from plasma, red cells, and bile, and in bile acids of bile.

It is suggested that papain acts to produce single polysaccharide chains, whereas other proteolytic enzymes tried give evidence of twin-chain residues. 4.

16033753<A study of some factors that influence the iodination of ox insulin.<1. The influence of carrier iodide, iodine monochloride and pH on the labelling of ox insulin with (131)I by the iodine monochloride method have been studied. 2. The quantitative effect of the iodide in the radioactive iodine preparation was that predicted from a calculation of its specific activity. No other interfering factors were detected in the [(131)I]iodide solutions used. 3. Increasing the molar ratio of iodine monochloride to insulin resulted in an increase followed progressively by a decrease in the proportion of (131)I bound, while the total iodine bound increased to an amount characteristic of pH and thereafter remained constant. 4. The influence of pH on the iodination of insulin with iodine monochloride was complex and the pH curve showed two maxima, at pH2.8 and 6.4. At pH2.8 it was not possible to exceed 8 atoms of iodine bound per molecule by increasing the molar ratio of iodine monochloride. Similarly, at pH6.4 the substitution value of 11.5 atoms of iodine per molecule could not be exceeded. 5. Iodinated insulins containing an average of 1.96, 2.74, 6.0 and 7.0 atoms of iodine per molecule fully retained the ability to bind guinea-pig anti-(ox insulin) serum, and the ability to compete with unlabelled insulin for antibody sites only became significantly changed in the most highly substituted preparations and in the presence of large concentrations of unlabelled insulin. 6. The method for the iodination of insulin with 98% incorporation of (131)I by using chloramine-t is described. 7. (131)I-iodinated insulin prepared with graded quantities of chloramine-t in excess of that required for efficient labelling was less efficiently bound by guinea-pig anti-(ox insulin) serum than insulin labelled by the iodine monochloride method.<Animals, Antigen-Antibody Reactions, Cattle, Chemical Phenomena, Chemistry, Chloramines, Electrophoresis, Guinea Pigs, Insulin, Iodine, Iodine Isotopes

The isoenzyme pattern obtained was shown to be similar to that of the kidney cortex and medulla but different from that of the bladder and kidney pelvis. 2. The values for the relative activity and Michaelis constant of urinary lactate dehydrogenase were similar to those for kidney cortex and medulla but significantly different from those obtained for bladder and kidney pelvis. 3. The molecular weight of urinary lactate dehydrogenase was estimated by thin-layer chromatogtaphy on Sephadex G-200. The values obtained for several samples of urine ranged from 129 000 to 155 000 and were very close to that of the crystalline rabbit-muscle enzyme (140 000). 4. The question of the possible origin of urinary lactate dehydrogenase is discussed and the conclusion drawn that the kidney and not the plasma is the most likely source.<Chemical Phenomena, Chemistry, Electrophoresis, Humans, L-Lactate Dehydrogenase, urine, Molecular Weight
16033756<Isolation and properties of polyribosomes and fragments of the endoplasmic reticulum from rat liver.<1. A centrifugation method for the fractionation of the postmitochondrial fraction from rat-liver homogenates is described. The technique, in which no detergent is used, may be used as a tool to discriminate between two classes of ribosomes. One class is firmly bound to membranes and the other consists either of free polysomes or of ribosomes attached by weaker forces to the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum. 2. Electron-micrograph studies revealed that the polysomes were not contaminated with bound ribosomes or with membranous fragments. 3. The separated fractions were characterized by their RNA, protein, ribonuclease and phospholipid content. 4. The influence of starvation on the RNA and protein contents of the different fractions was investigated. 5. Labelling of the various centrifugal fractions in vivo revealed no difference in uptake of radioactive amino acid between the two classes of ribosomes. 6. Incorporation of radioactive leucine in vitro and the polyuridylic acid-directed phenylalanine incorporation were similar for both classes of ribosomes.<Animals, Carbon Isotopes, Endoplasmic Reticulum, analysis, Leucine, metabolism, Liver, analysis, cytology, Male, Membranes, Microscopy, Electron, Phenylalanine, metabolism, Phospholipids, analysis, Proteins, analysis, RNA, analysis, Rats, Ribonucleases, analysis, Ribosomes, analysis, Starvation, Ultracentrifugation
16033757<Control of the citric acid cycle by glyoxylate. Mechanism of the inhibition by oxalomalate and gamma-hydroxy-alpha-oxoglutarate.<1. Hydroxyoxoglutarate was obtained by three methods: decarboxylation of oxalomalic acid, and synthesis from glyoxylate and pyruvate by using either Mg(2+) or an enzyme from rat liver as catalysts. 2. The inhibitory effects of oxalomalate and hydroxyoxoglutarate upon aconitate hydratase, isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP) and oxoglutarate dehydrogenase were investigated. 3. Oxalomalate at low concentrations (1mm) inhibited almost completely both aconitate hydratase and isocitrate dehydrogenase. Hydroxyoxoglutarate also inhibited these enzymes, but at concentrations approximately tenfold that of oxalomalate. 4. Oxalomalate and hydroxyoxoglutarate, at the higher concentrations, inhibited oxoglutarate dehydrogenase to approximately the same extent. 5. It is suggested that the ability of glyoxylate to control reaction rates in the tricarboxylic acid cycle must in some degree be due to its condensation with oxaloacetate and pyruvate to form enzyme inhibitors.<Chemical Phenomena, Chemistry, Citric Acid Cycle, Enzymes, Glutarates, Glyoxylates, Hydro-Lyases, Isocitrate Dehydrogenase, Malates, Pyruvates
16033758<The biosynthesis of dicoumarol.<Micro-organisms have been isolated that can utilize o-coumaric acid as a sole carbon source with the subsequent production of 4-hydroxycoumarin and dicoumarol. One of these organisms, Penicillium jenseni, has been used to examine the biosynthesis of dicoumarol. Certain thermophilic fungi have also been found that can convert o-coumaric acid into dicoumarol.<Chromatography, Paper, Coumarins, biosynthesis, metabolism, Fungi, metabolism, Mucor, metabolism, Pseudomonas, metabolism, Soil Microbiology, Spectrum Analysis
16033759<The enzymes of adenine nucleotide metabolism in developing skeletal muscle.<1. During late foetal and early post-natal development of rabbit skeletal muscle the total protein increased more rapidly than the non-protein nitrogen content per g. wet wt. 2. AMP-deaminase activity of rabbit leg muscles increased rapidly over the period 5-15 days after birth. In diaphragm muscle from the same animal the rapid increase to the adult enzymic activity took place at about the time of birth. 3. The rapid increase in AMP-deaminase activity of leg muscle occurred earlier in animals born relatively mature, such as the chick and guinea pig, than in animals less well developed at birth, such as the rabbit and rat. 4. The pattern of enzymic activity shown by AMP deaminase during development in diaphragm, leg and cardiac muscles in a given species was closely paralleled by those of adenylate kinase and creatine phosphokinase. 5. When young rabbits were encouraged to become active at an earlier stage than is normal, the rise in creatine-phosphokinase activity occurred at an earlier age than in the control animals. 6. The results suggest that the activity pattern of the muscle is an important factor in determining the time at which the activities of the enzymes of special significance for muscle rise sharply to the adult values. 7. Development in rabbit leg muscle also involved an increase in aldolase activity. The pattern of change was similar to that obtained with other enzymes studied.<Adenine Nucleotides, metabolism, Aminohydrolases, metabolism, Animals, Chick Embryo, Creatine Kinase, metabolism, Fetus, metabolism, Fructose-Bisphosphate Aldolase, metabolism, Guinea Pigs, Muscle Development, Muscles, embryology, enzymology, Nucleotidases, metabolism, Phosphotransferases, metabolism, Poultry, Proteins, analysis, Rabbits, Rats, Species Specificity
16033760<A cell-free system for the study of alpha-amylase synthesis in barley aleurone layers.<1. A cell-free system capable of alpha-amylase synthesis has been obtained from the aleurone layers of germinating barley. 2. This system requires potassium chloride, sucrose and an amino acid mixture in order to function. The crude preparation does not require calcium chloride. Chloramphenicol inhibits alpha-amylase synthesis as indicated both by increase in measurable enzyme activity and incorporation of l-[U-(14)C]glutamic acid.<Amino Acids, Amylases, biosynthesis, Calcium Chloride, Carbon Isotopes, Chloramphenicol, Edible Grain, metabolism, Potassium Chloride, Sucrose
16033761<Effect of cell age on erythrocyte fatty acid composition in rats on different dietary regimes.<1. Rat erythrocytes were fractionated into young, mature and old cell fractions by centrifugation. The fatty acid composition of each fraction was determined by gas-liquid chromatography, under four different dietary conditions: with adequate linoleic acid in the diet, with a diet deficient in linoleic acid, and with the deficient diet supplemented with corn oil for 3 and 12 days. 2. Significant differences were observed in the fatty acid composition of cells of different ages on all diets. The pattern of fatty acid distribution depended on the particular acid in question, on its concentration in the total erythrocyte sample and on the nature of the dietary fat. 3. When corn oil was fed to rats that had been fed previously on a deficient diet, the changes in fatty acid composition that occurred depended on the acid and on the cell age. For example, young cells were more active in incorporating palmitic acid and arachidonic acid but incorporated linoleic acid at a slightly lower rate than older cells. 4. These results are believed to indicate the presence in the erythrocyte of transacylases with different specificities, and to show that transacylase activity changes as the cells age.<Animals, Chromatography, Gas, Diet, Dietary Fats, Erythrocyte Aging, Erythrocytes, metabolism, Fatty Acids, metabolism, Fatty Acids, Essential, metabolism, Linoleic Acids, pharmacology, Male, Rats, Transferases, blood
16033762<The degradation of ribonucleic acid in the cotyledons of Pisum arvense.<1. A ribonuclease has been partially purified from the cotyledons of germinating seed of Pisum arvense. 2. The enzyme degrades ribopolynucleotides to adenosine 3'-phosphate, guanosine 3'-phosphate and the cyclic nucleotides cytidine 2',3'-phosphate and uridine 2',3'-phosphate; no resistant ;core' remains. 3. The activity of RNA-degrading enzymes in the cotyledons increases to a maximum during the first 5 days of germination, passes through a minimum around the eighth day, and thereafter increases again. 4. Ion-exchange chromatography of methanol-soluble extracts of cotyledons revealed the presence, amongst other components, of the 2'-, 3'- and 5'-phosphates of cytidine and uridine, the 3'- and 5'-phosphates of adenosine, and guanosine 5'-phosphate. 5. Seed soaked in a solution containing [(32)P]orthophosphate gave a methanol-soluble fraction containing labelled nucleoside 5'-phosphates, but nucleoside 2'- and 3'-phosphates were not labelled. 6. It is believed that the nucleoside 2'- and 3'-phosphates arise by the action of ribonuclease on cotyledon RNA.<Chromatography, Ion Exchange, Chromatography, Paper, Electrophoresis, Nucleotidases, pharmacology, Nucleotides, analysis, Phosphates, metabolism, Phosphorus Isotopes, Plants, metabolism, RNA, metabolism, Ribonucleases, metabolism
16033763<Enzymes in cancer. Asparaginase from chicken liver.<1. A procedure for partial purification of asparaginase from chicken liver is presented. 2. The bulk of the enzyme is located in the soluble fraction of chicken liver. 3. Molecular weights of chicken-liver asparaginase and of the guinea-pig serum enzyme, estimated by gel filtration, were 306000 and 210000 respectively. The Michaelis constants (K(m)) at 37 degrees and pH8.5 were 6.0x10(-5)m and 7.2x10(-5)m respectively. 4. At 50 degrees the chicken-liver enzyme was moderately stable, some activity being lost by aggregation; in dilute electrolyte solutions the activity rapidly diminished. 5. The anti-lymphoma effect of guinea-pig serum in mice carrying the 6C3HED tumour was confirmed. Chicken-liver asparaginase also showed an effect but in this case the enzyme preparation had to be administered repeatedly. 6. Guinea-pig serum asparaginase was stable for several days in mouse blood, after intraperitoneal injection, whereas chicken-liver asparaginase rapidly disappeared. 7. Aspartic acid beta-hydrazide was shown to be a competitive inhibitor of chicken-liver asparaginase with K(i) approx. 5.6x10(-4)m. In mice it produced an anti-lymphoma effect, as reported previously.<Amidohydrolases, analysis, therapeutic use, Animals, Aspartic Acid, pharmacology, Cattle, Chromatography, Gel, Enzymes, blood, Guinea Pigs, Hydrazines, pharmacology, Kinetics, Liver, enzymology, Lymphoma, drug therapy, Mice, Molecular Weight, Neoplasms, Experimental, drug therapy, Poultry, Rabbits, Rats
16033764<Glucose metabolism by human placental villi.<1. Glucose phosphorylation rates of about 1 mumole/g./min. have been measured at room temperature in homogenates of human placental chorionic villi, and these rates are relatively constant throughout gestation. 2. This reaction has an apparent K(m) for glucose of 3x10(-5)m both in early and term placenta. 3. Human foetal membranes, the amnion and chorion, also phosphorylate glucose at a rate about equal to that of the placenta. 4. On incubation of intact bits of villus tissue from 8-12-week or full-term placenta with labelled pyruvate, followed by paper chromatography of the tissue extract, the following distribution of label was observed: residual pyruvate, 40-60%; lactate, 30-50%; glucose, 6%; fructose, 7%; sorbitol, 0.6%. 5. The concept of the placenta acting as a foetal liver during early pregnancy is inconsistent with the observation that glucose production by this organ persists up to term.<Chromatography, Paper, Female, Glucose, metabolism, Hexokinase, analysis, Humans, Phosphates, metabolism, Placenta, metabolism, Pregnancy, Pyruvates, metabolism
16033765<Sedimentation, viscosity and partial specific volumes of membrane proteins and lipoproteins.<1. Lipoproteins or defatted proteins from the membrane of Halobacterium halobium were dissolved in 0.02m-phosphate buffer, pH7.4, with or without urea (8m). Physicochemical measurements were made on these solutions with and without addition of sodium chloride. 2. In the presence of 8m-urea the lipoproteins could be resolved into two sedimenting groups. The faster group had an average apparent molecular weight of 390 000; sedimentation coefficients of the slower group could not be determined. 3. Proteins that had been defatted by extraction with a chloroform-methanol mixture could also be resolved into two groups distinguished by their sedimentation velocities. Sedimentation coefficients of both groups were readily determined. The average apparent molecular weight of the faster group of defatted proteins in 8m-urea was 340 000 and that of the slower group was 97 000. It is concluded that attachment of lipid does not affect the state of aggregation of the proteins in 8m-urea. 4. Intrinsic viscosities of lipoproteins and defatted proteins were higher than is customary for globular proteins and suggest expanded highly-solvated molecules, consistent with the ;denaturing' action on the proteins of solutions of low ionic strength.<Bacterial Proteins, analysis, Chemical Phenomena, Chemistry, Halobacterium, analysis, Lipoproteins, analysis, Membranes, analysis, Molecular Weight, Sodium Chloride, Ultracentrifugation, Viscosity
16033766<The use of the logarithmic transformation in the calculation of the transport parameters of a system that obeys Michaelis-Menten kinetics.<1. A logarithmic method is described for the calculation of the transport parameters, K(m) and V(max.)' of a biological system obeying Michaelis-Menten kinetics. 2. This logarithmic method leads to a way of estimating the transport parameters that has not apparently been used previously. It allows the separation of variance due to V(max.) from other variance, and so reduces the fiducial limits that can be placed on an estimation of K(m). 3. The results of studies on the transport of l-histidine and l-monoiodohistidine by rat intestinal sacs in vitro have been used to illustrate the application of the new method. Estimates of the transport parameters have also been made by two alternative procedures. The relative merits of the three methods are discussed.<Animals, Biological Transport, Active, Histidine, metabolism, In Vitro Techniques, Intestine, Small, metabolism, Kinetics, Male, Rats
16033767<The effect of copper deficiency on the induction of tryptophan pyrrolase in chick liver by hydrocortisone.<The induction of tryptophan pyrrolase in chick liver by hydrocortisone was studied in copper- and magnesium-deficient chicks. Magnesium deficiency did not influence the induction of the enzyme, whereas copper deficiency significantly decreased it. These results suggest that tryptophan pyrrolase of chick liver, like that in Pseudomonas, is a copper-containing enzyme.<Animals, Copper, metabolism, Deficiency Diseases, metabolism, Enzyme Induction, Hydrocortisone, pharmacology, Liver, enzymology, Magnesium Deficiency, metabolism, Oxygenases, biosynthesis, Poultry, Tryptophan Oxygenase, biosynthesis
16033768<The effect of the aflatoxins B1, G1, and G2 on protein and nucleic acid synthesis in rat liver.<A comparison has been made of the difference spectra obtained by causing various aflatoxins (B(1), G(1) and G(2)) to interact with calf-thymus DNA. The effect of these toxins on RNA and protein synthesis by rat-liver slices has been measured. The extent of their inhibitory action on the synthetic reactions was proportional to the degree of spectral shift obtained with their interaction with DNA. It is proposed that their toxicity depends on this interaction. It was demonstrated that the RNA polymerase of nucleoli isolated from the livers of aflatoxin B(1)-poisoned rats was inhibited. This finding is in agreement with the proposed mechanism for the hepatotoxic action of aflatoxin.<Aflatoxins, pharmacology, Animals, Carbon Isotopes, Liver, drug effects, metabolism, Male, Nucleic Acids, biosynthesis, Nucleotidyltransferases, metabolism, Protein Biosynthesis, Rats, Spectrum Analysis
16033769<The 'compartmentation' of choline acetyltransferase within the synaptosome.<1. Choline acetyltransferase may be isolated in either a bound or soluble form after hypo-osmotic treatment of a crude synaptosome fraction, depending on the conditions. 2. In the bound form, the enzyme appears to be associated with the larger membrane fragments rather than with synaptic vesicles. 3. The bound form is predominant at slightly acid pH values and low ionic strength, the soluble form under more physiological conditions of pH and ionic strength. 4. Sodium chloride, potassium chloride, magnesium chloride and calcium chloride at similar ionic strengths solubilize the enzyme. 5. Choline acetyltransferase was found to be soluble under these conditions after release from synaptosomes from rat and pigeon cerebra, guinea-pig cortex and rabbit cortex, caudate nuclei, diencephalon and midbrain. 6. Certain isoenzymes of lactate dehydrogenase behaved similarly.<Acyltransferases, Animals, Brain, enzymology, Centrifugation, Density Gradient, Chemical Phenomena, Chemistry, Electrophoresis, Guinea Pigs, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Rabbits, Rats, Species Specificity
16033770<Protein synthesis by microsomal particles from regenerating rat liver.<1. Washed microsome particles from regenerating liver were shown to incorporate [(14)C]leucine into protein more actively than similar preparations from normal liver. 2. The total incorporation in the preparations from regenerating liver increased linearly with the amount of protein incubated, whereas this was not so with preparations from normal liver. 3. The greater activity of regenerating-liver microsomes appeared to be associated with the bound polysomes. 4. The size distribution of polysomes obtained after removal of membrane with deoxycholate was the same in normal and regenerating liver. 5. In general the activity of polysome preparations from normal and regenerating liver was similar. 6. It is concluded that the greater activity of the particles in the microsome fraction from regenerating liver is to be attributed to the ribosomes bound to membrane and that their activity is controlled by factors present in the membrane.<Animals, Carbon Isotopes, Detergents, metabolism, Liver, metabolism, Liver Regeneration, Microsomes, metabolism, Protein Biosynthesis, Rats, Ribosomes, metabolism
16033771<The purification and properties of histidinol dehydrogenase from Neurospora crassa.<1. A procedure is described for the purification of l-histidinol dehydrogenase (l-histidinol-NAD oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.23) from Neurospora crassa. 2. The enzyme, as purified, has a sedimentation coefficient, S(20), of 7.1s and a molecular weight of 81 000. Considerable variation is possible in the state of polymerization of the enzyme, giving rise to observed molecular weights from 40 000 to 240 000. 3. Several kinetic parameters of the enzyme have been determined. The enzyme is maximally active at pH9.8; the K(m) (NAD) is 13.0x10(-5)m and K(m) (histidinol) is 8.2x10(-6)m. The enzyme is highly specific, does not oxidize a range of amino alcohols and other aliphatic alcohols nor reduce NADP and has no demonstrable affinity for histidine. The turnover number is 49 moles of NAD reduced/min./mole of enzyme (mol.wt. 40 000).<Alcohol Oxidoreductases, Chemical Phenomena, Chemistry, Chromatography, Chromatography, Gel, Chromatography, Ion Exchange, Electrophoresis, Enzymes, Histidine, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Kinetics, Molecular Weight, Neurospora, enzymology, Ultracentrifugation

The corresponding monoaryl phosphates were identified in extracts of insects or excreta along with the beta-glucosides and ethereal sulphates of the phenols. 3.

16033774<Species differences in the inhibition of glutathione S-aryltransferase by phthaleins and dicarboxylic acids.<1. Glutathione-S-aryltransferase activity from grass grubs (Costelytra zealandica) was inhibited by phthaleins, sulphonphthaleins and some dicarboxylic acids. 2. These compounds had no detectable action on the enzyme from sheep liver. 3. In insect enzyme the inhibition was competitive with respect to glutathione and non-competitive with respect to the aromatic substrate. 4. Michaelis constants and inhibitor constants were measured for sheep-liver or grass-grub enzyme between pH5 and pH10 and evidence was obtained for the presence of two groups with pK9.2 in the glutathione-binding site of the insect enzyme. 5. Only one such group was detected in the sheep-liver enzyme.<Animals, Chemical Phenomena, Chemistry, Dicarboxylic Acids, Enzymes, Fatty Acids, Fluoresceins, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Insecta, enzymology, Kinetics, Liver, enzymology, Phenolphthaleins, Sheep, Species Specificity, Spectrophotometry, Transferases
16033776<Thin-layer chromatography of 1-dimethylaminonaphthalene-5-sulphonyl derivatives of amino acids present in superfusates of cat cerebral cortex.<1. Five new solvent systems are reported for the separation of 1-dimethylaminonaphthalene-5-sulphonylamino acids by thin-layer chromatography on silica gel. After two-dimensional chromatography with a suitable pair of these solvent systems, most of the 1-dimethylaminonaphthalene-5-sulphonyl derivatives were completely separated and could be located by their intense yellow fluorescence when viewed under u.v. light. 2. These techniques have been used to identify 21 amino acids present in superfusates of cat cerebral cortex, plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. 3. A method for the semiquantitative estimation of amino acids in biological fluids is described in which the fluorescent intensity of their separated 1-dimethylaminonaphthalene-5-sulphonyl derivatives was measured.<Amino Acids, analysis, blood, cerebrospinal fluid, Animals, Cats, Cerebral Cortex, analysis, Chromatography, Thin Layer, Naphthalenes, analysis, blood, cerebrospinal fluid, Solvents
16033777<Rat small-intestinal beta-galactosidases. Influence of pH on the hydrolysis of different substrates.<1. The influence of pH and the kind of buffer on the hydrolysis of lactose and four hetero-beta-galactosides (phenyl beta-galactoside, o-nitrophenyl beta-galactoside, p-nitrophenyl beta-galactoside and 6-bromo-2-naphthyl beta-galactoside) by homogenates of rat small-intestinal mucosa has been studied. 2. There are at least two beta-galactosidases present in the homogenates, one with optimum pH3-4 and another with optimum pH5-6. 3. The enzyme with the lower pH optimum is mainly a heterogalactosidase. It hydrolyses lactose slowly. The other enzyme is mainly a disaccharidase, since it hydrolyses lactose much more rapidly than the heterogalactosides. 4. Under the conditions used, citrate had an inhibitory effect on the 6-bromo-2-naphthyl beta-galactosidase activity at pH3-4, but did not influence the 6-bromo-2-naphthyl beta-galactosidase activity at pH5-6 or the hydrolysis of the other substrates at any pH.<Animals, Chemical Phenomena, Chemistry, Citrates, Galactosidases, Glycosides, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Intestine, Small, enzymology, Lactose, Rats
16033778<The inhibition of mucopeptide synthesis by benzylpenicillin in relation to irreversible fixation of the antibiotic by staphylococci.<1. Benzylpenicillin is irreversibly fixed to staphyloccoci by a reaction that obeys second-order kinetics, whereas the progress of inhibition of mucopeptide synthesis obeys first-order kinetics after a short lag during which the antibiotic has no effect. 2. When the micro-organisms are saturated with benzylpenicillin they can still make mucopeptide in solutions containing chloramphenicol at a normal rate after a lag period. 3. About 90% of the benzylpenicillin stays fixed to the cells after mucopeptide synthesis has reached its maximum and constant rate. 4. During the phase when mucopeptide synthesis by cells saturated with benzylpenicillin is accelerating, a small number of additional sites that fix benzylpenicillin is revealed. The number of these sites reaches a maximum and constant value at about the same time as mucopeptide biosynthesis reaches a maximum and constant rate. 5. Staphylococci saturated with benzylpenicillin are exceedingly sensitive to fresh additions of the antibiotic. 6. The degree of inhibition of mucopeptide synthesis caused by these small amounts of antibiotic agrees with the degree of substitution by benzylpenicillin of the newly revealed or ;sensitive' sites. 7. Since these sensitive sites are revealed during incubation of the bacteria with chloramphenicol it is unlikely that they are due to newly formed protein. 8. On the basis of these results, a hypothesis for the inhibition by penicillin of the cross-linking reaction in the terminal stages of mucopeptide synthesis is suggested.<Carbon Isotopes, Kinetics, Mucoproteins, biosynthesis, Penicillin G, pharmacology, Staphylococcus, drug effects, metabolism
16033930<A strand of cardiac muscle. Its ultrastructure and the electrophysiological implications of its geometry.<The structure of a small strand of rabbit heart muscle fibers (trabecula carnea), 30-80 micro in diameter, has been examined with light and electron microscopy. By establishing a correlation between the appearance of regions of close fiber contact in light and electron microscopy, the extent and distribution of regions of close apposition of fibers has been evaluated in approximately 200 micro length of a strand. The distribution of possible regions of resistive coupling between fibers has been approximated by a model system of cables. The theoretical linear electrical properties of such a system have been analyzed and the implications of the results of this analysis are discussed. Since this preparation is to be used for correlated studies of the electrical, mechanical, and cytochemical properties of cardiac muscle, a comprehensive study of the morphology of this preparation has been made. The muscle fibers in it are distinguished from those of the rabbit papillary muscle, in that they have no triads and have a kind of mitochondrion not found in papillary muscle. No evidence of a transverse tubular system was found, but junctions of cisternae of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and the sarcolemma, peripheral couplings, were present. The electrophysiological implications of the absence of transverse tubules are discussed. The cisternae of the couplings showed periodic tubular extensions toward the sarcolemma. A regularly spaced array of Z line-like material was observed, suggesting a possible mechanism for sarcomere growth.<Animals, Electrophysiology, Endoplasmic Reticulum, Heart, physiology, Mathematics, Membrane Potentials, physiology, Microscopy, Electron, Mitochondria, Models, Theoretical, Myocardium, cytology, Neurilemma, Papillary Muscles, cytology, Rabbits, Schwann Cells, cytology
16033931<Ultrastructure of the shoot apex of Chenopodium album and certain other seed plants.<The ultrastructure of cells of the vegetative shoot apices is described for Chenopodium album, Kalanchoë blossfeldiana and K. laxiflora, Bryophyllum daigremontianum, Nicotiana rustica, and N. tabacum (Maryland Mammoth), and Ginkgo biloba. A less intensive study was made of the last three listed. The structures and organelles usually associated with meristematic cells were observed: dictyosomes, plastids (in various stages of development), mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), vacuoles, lipid droplets, and plasmalemma. In addition, spherosome-like structures were observed in all zones of the shoot apices. Also, multivesicular bodies were observed in C. album and B. daigremontianum. Ribosome density is greater in cells of the flank meristem. Proplastids, plastids with prolamellar bodies, or grana have a differential distribution in the apex, characteristic for a particular species. Confirmation could not be given to the concept that vacuoles arise as a series of local dilations in long extensions of the so called "smooth ER." The tonoplast and ER are distinguishable at the time of inception of a vacuole, although the tonoplast may arise from the ER. Rapid growth of a vacuole and/or fusion with other vacuoles may result in irregularly shaped prevacuoles. No vacuoles were observed to originate from cisternae of dictyosomes in the species studied.<Cell Division, Cell Membrane, Cell Wall, Chloroplasts, Endoplasmic Reticulum, Microscopy, Electron, Mitochondria, Organoids, Plant Cells, Ribosomes
16033932<Fine structure of protein-storing plastids in bean root tips.<The fine structure of leucoplasts in root tip cells of Phaseolus vulgaris L. has been studied in material fixed in glutaraldehyde followed by osmium tetroxide and poststained in uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Plastid development has been followed from the young stages in and near the meristematic region, through an ameboid stage, to the larger forms with more abundant storage products in the outermost cells. The plastids contain a dense stroma penetrated by tubules and cisternae arising from the inner membrane of the plastid envelope. Also located in the stroma are lamellae, ribosome-like particles, phytoferritin granules, and fine fibrils in less dense regions. In some elongate plastids microfilaments run lengthwise in the stroma near the surface. The same plastids store both starch and protein, but in a strikingly different manner. The starch is deposited in the stroma, while the protein always is accumulated within membrane-bounded sacs. These sacs arise as outgrowths from a complex of interconnected tubules which in turn appears to originate by coalescence and proliferation of tubules and cisternae arising from the inner plastid membrane. This "tubular complex" bears a strong resemblance to the prolamellar body of etiolated chloroplasts, but is smaller and ordinarily less regularly organized, and is apparently light-insensitive. Crystallization of the protein commonly occurs in the sacs and occasionally takes place within the tubules of the complex as well. The fine structure of the leucoplasts is discussed in relation to that of etiolated chloroplasts. Suggestions are made concerning the function of the tubular complex, role of the ameboid plastid forms, and manner of accumulation of the storage protein in the plastids.<Cell Differentiation, Cell Division, Chloroplasts, Cytoplasmic Granules, Ferritins, analysis, Plant Cells, Proteins, analysis, Ribosomes, analysis, Starch, analysis
16033933<A peculiar configuration of agranular reticulum (canaliculate lamellar body) in the rat pinealocyte.<A cytoplasmic structure exhibiting a peculiar configuration of agranular reticulum has been found in the rat pinealocyte, and has been designated a canaliculate lamellar body. It consists of a number of fenestrated, flat cisternae which are closely spaced. They bear some distant resemblance to the annulate lamellae previously reported in a variety of cell types. Profiles of stacks of lamellae in a plane of section always display two distinct aspects, the surface and the cross-sectional views of flat cisternae. A surface view shows the hexagonal arrangement of pores or fenestrations. The pores in successive lamellae are aligned precisely, one behind the other, so that clear, cylindrical channels are seen running perpendicular to the lamellae as indicated by transverse sections of the lamellar stacks. Large canaliculate lamellar bodies are composed of many extended series of lamellar stacks which pursue a tortuous course and cross one another. Occasionally the canaliculate lamellar body is located deep in a nuclear invagination, which reminds one of the so-called nuclear pellets (Kernkugeln) reported by light microscopy. The functional significance of the body is unknown.<Animals, Cytoplasm, Endoplasmic Reticulum, Female, Male, Pineal Gland, cytology, Rats
16033934<Structural variations during mitosis in the chick embryo.<Selected tissues from chick embryos were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde and 1% OsO(4), both buffered at pH 7.6 with Veronal-acetate, and were embedded in Maraglas or Araldite. Two types of cell division have been noted. Generally, epithelial cells divide predominantly by a shortening of the chromosome-to-pole distance rather than by spindle elongation; mesenchymal cells undergo extensive spindle elongation. The presence of numerous continuous microtubules in cells that undergo extensive spindle elongation functionally implicates these tubules in the elongation process. In most embryonic epithelia, the cleavage furrow converges to a fixed site forming a mid-body near the anchoring desmosomes at the free surface; symmetrical furrow formation is typical of mesenchymal cells which lack desmosomes.

The extract was given to rats intraperitoneally, in single or repeated doses of 1-14 units (USP) per gram body weight, over short or extended periods, and the tissue was examined between 6 and 26 hr after the commencement of injection. During this period, osteoblasts showed the greatest changes. Their mitochondria became swollen and contained dense granules; both rough- and smooth-surfaced vesicles were distended; ribosomes were separated from the membranes; and various dense bodies appeared in the cytoplasm. Osteocytes were similarly but less affected, and osteoclasts differed little from those in normal animals. Eventually after repeated injections, the fine structure of many of the cells was disrupted. These changes were accompanied by erosion of the bony trabeculae without any great increase in numbers of osteoclasts. It is possible that the alterations in fine structure were the result of damage to the cells by the parathyroid extract. However, since the extract did not seem to stimulate classical osteoclastic activity, the mitochondrial swelling and dense bodies could have been related to the removal of mineral and matrix, respectively.<Animals, Calcification, Physiologic, Cytoplasm, drug effects, Cytoplasmic Granules, drug effects, Membranes, drug effects, Microscopy, Microscopy, Electron, Mitochondria, drug effects, Osteoblasts, drug effects, Osteoclasts, drug effects, Osteocytes, drug effects, Parathyroid Hormone, administration &amp; dosage, pharmacology, Rats, Ribosomes, drug effects
16033941<Studies of spermatogenesis in the hepaticae. I. Ultrastructure of the vierergruppe in Marchantia.<Spermatids of the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha were shown by analysis of thin-sections to contain a four-layered organelle, the Vierergruppe, lying between the flagellar bases above and a subjacent mitochondrial body. The uppermost layer consists of parallel tubules structurally similar to those of the axoneme. Some of the tubules extend beyond the four-layered region to form a long ribbon-like appendage. The second layer consists of low, vertical, membranous fins connected by numerous short links to the tubules above. The third layer, limited above and below by two horizontal membranes, consists of vertical partitions, apparently continuous with the fins. The fourth and lowermost layer consists of narrow parallel tubules aligned beneath alternate partitions. The long axes of the lower three layers are parallel to each other and lie at an angle of 48 degrees to the tubule axis of the uppermost stratum. A graphic representation of a three-dimensional scale model interpreting organelle structure is given. The Vierergruppe supersedes Dreiergruppe interpretation in most if not all of the bryophytes studied to date.<Cell Division, physiology, Cell Membrane, Flagella, Male, Microscopy, Electron, Mitochondria, Organoids, Plant Cells
16033942<The renewal of photoreceptor cell outer segments.<The utilization of methionine-(3)H by retinal photoreceptor cells has been studied by radioautographic technique in the rat, mouse, and frog. In all three species, the labeled amino acid is concentrated initially in the inner segment of the cell. Within 24 hr, the radioactive material is displaced to the base of the outer segment, where it accumulates as a distinct reaction band. The reaction band then gradually moves along the outer segment and ultimately disappears at the apex of the cell, which is in contact with the retinal pigment epithelium. These findings are interpreted to indicate that the photoreceptor cell outer segment is continually renewed, by the repeated lamellar apposition of material (membranous discs) at the base of the outer segment, in conjunction with a balanced removal of material at its apex. The outer segment renewal rate is accelerated in frogs when ambient temperature is raised, and is elevated in both frogs and rats when the intensity of retinal illumination is increased.<Animals, Anura, Autoradiography, Epithelial Cells, Eye Proteins, metabolism, Light, Methionine, metabolism, Mice, Photoreceptor Cells, cytology, metabolism, Rats, Retinal Pigments, Temperature, Tritium
16033943<The localization of acetylcholinesterase at the autonomic neuromuscular junction.<Acetylcholinesterase has been localized at the autonomic neuromuscular junction in the bladder of the toad (Bufo marinus) by the Karnovsky method. High levels of enzyme activity have been demonstrated in association with the membranes of cholinergic axons and the adjacent membranes of the accompanying Schwann cells. The synaptic vesicles stained in occasional cholinergic axons. After longer incubation times, the membrane of smooth muscle cells close to cholinergic axons also stained. Axons with only moderate acetylcholinesterase activity or with no activity at all were seen in the same bundles as cholinergic axons, but identification of the transmitter in these axons was not possible.<Acetylcholinesterase, analysis, Animals, Anura, Autonomic Nervous System, enzymology, Axons, enzymology, Histocytochemistry, Neurilemma, enzymology, Neuromuscular Junction, enzymology, Schwann Cells, enzymology, Urinary Bladder, enzymology
16034111<Spatial and temporal summation in impaired regions of the visual field.<1. Spatial and temporal summation have been measured in perimetrically impaired regions of the visual field. Two classes of impairment have been studied: that resulting from lesions in the pre-geniculate visual pathways, and that resulting from post-geniculate lesions (optic radiation and/or striate cortex).2. Control measurements were made in the perimetrically normal visual fields of subjects without visual pathway damage.3. Spatial summation was found altered in all impaired visual fields: the greater the threshold elevation produced by the lesion, the more nearly complete was spatial summation.4. The above relation between threshold and spatial summation has also been given numerical form. This has been shown to be very nearly identical to the threshold-spatial summation relation which is seen as stimuli are increasingly peripherally presented in normal visual fields.5. It has been shown that the alterations of spatial summation brought about by a lesion are found only in those parts of the visual field which are perimetrically impaired: spatial summation is always normal in perimetrically normal regions of a visual field, even if other parts of the same field show impairment.6. Temporal summation has been found altered in visual fields impaired by post-geniculate lesions: the greater the threshold elevation produced by the lesion, the more nearly complete was temporal summation. These changes in temporal summation were found only in perimetrically impaired regions of the field.7. Temporal summation was normal in visual fields impaired by pregeniculate lesions.<Geniculate Bodies, physiology, Humans, Psychophysiology, Retina, physiology, Visual Field Tests, Visual Fields
16034112<The relation between heat produced and phosphorylcreatine split during isometric contraction of frog's muscle.<1. Heat production, tension development and phosphorylcreatine (PC) splitting have been measured simultaneously during isometric contractions of iodoacetate-poisoned frogs' sartorii at 0 degrees C. The muscles were stimulated to produce a series of 30 twitches or a 10 sec tetanus or a 30 sec tetanus.2. Of the several possible methods of calculating PC breakdown the best appears to be the one based on the assumption that PC/(total creatine) was originally the same in the two muscles of a pair.3. The difficulty of expressing PC break-down, heat production etc. in terms of the muscle's size is demonstrated.4. Several artifacts are discussed, including the heat produced by the stimulus and the possible role of reactions other than PC splitting.5. Even when these have been substantially eliminated there remains the rather intractable statistical problem of establishing a functional relationship between heat produced and PC split when both of these variables contain errors, so that ordinary regression analysis is misleading. It is shown that this problem can be dealt with satisfactorily by introducing other instrumental variables that can be determined experimentally.6. The final conclusion is that the in vivo enthalpy of hydrolysis of PC is about 10.6 kcal/mole, and is the same in twitches and in tetani.<Animals, Anura, Body Temperature Regulation, Creatine, analysis, Electric Stimulation, In Vitro Techniques, Iodoacetates, pharmacology, Muscle Contraction, physiology, Muscles, analysis, drug effects, physiology, Nitrogen, pharmacology, Organ Size, Phosphocreatine, analysis, Tetanus, Thermodynamics
16034113<Hyperpyruvaturia in experimental diabetes.<1. The 24 hourly excretion of pyruvate and glucose has been measured in alloxan-diabetic rats.2. The animals were allowed a 6-day control period before being injected with alloxan (I.V. 50 mg/kg body weight). The diabetes was treated by daily injections of insulin for a period of 6 days from the 7th to the 12th day following the alloxan injection.3. The pyruvate excretion increased more than 5-fold following the induction of diabetes, the values being 189 +/- 130 (S.D.) mug/24 hr in the control period rising to an average of 1002 +/- 664 (S.D.) mug/24 hr over the first 6 days of diabetes. The administration of insulin over the second 6-day period of diabetes caused the pyruvate excretion to decrease-though not significantly. Upon the withdrawal of the insulin treatment the pyruvate excretion increased significantly from 785 +/- 315 (S.D.) mug/24 hr to 2105 +/- 679 (S.D.) mug/24 hr, measured over a 5-day period. The final period of pyruvate excretion was significantly greater than the excretion over the first diabetic period.4. The glucose excretion during the initial diabetic period was 6.75 +/- 2.64 (S.D.) g/24 hr. The administration of insulin caused a 42% decrease in glucose excretion compared to a decrease of 22% for the pyruvate. The withdrawal of insulin caused the glucose excretion to increase by 149% while the pyruvate excretion increased by 157%.5. Diabetes was also induced temporarily by injections of anti-insulin serum and diazoxide. In each case significant glycosuria and hyperpyruvaturia were produced.6. The possible causes of the hyperpyruvaturia in diabetes are discussed.<Animals, Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental, drug therapy, metabolism, Diazoxide, pharmacology, Female, Glycosuria, Immune Sera, pharmacology, Insulin, Long-Acting, therapeutic use, Pyruvates, urine, Rats
16034114<The electrical properties of resting and secreting pancreas.<1. The electrical properties of the resting and stimulated pancreas have been studied in the anaesthetized cat. There is an inverse relationship between the frequency of applied alternating current and the resistivity and dielectric constant of the resting pancreas. The resistivity is also affected by the fat content of the gland. The impedance locus of the pancreas is similar to that of other tissues.2. On intravenous injection of secretin there is a brief increase, followed by a more marked decrease, in conductance and capacitance of the pancreas. The phase of decreased conductance is related to the flow of pancreatic juice. The decrease in conductance and the flow rate can be characterized by two closely related empirical equations.3. During secretin stimulation the sodium concentration in pancreatic tissue increases, and the potassium concentration falls.4. It is tentatively suggested that the decreased conductance across the secreting gland is mostly due to swelling of the secretory cells and to a minor degree is the result of changes in the composition of the secretion in the pancreatic ducts.5. In the anaesthetized cat the mean half life of the secretory action of secretin is 199 sec.<Animals, Cats, Chlorides, analysis, Electric Stimulation, Fats, analysis, Pancreas, analysis, drug effects, physiology, Pancreatic Juice, physiology, Potassium, analysis, Secretin, pharmacology, Secretory Rate, physiology, Sodium, analysis
16034115<Properties of the inhibitory potential of smooth muscle as observed in the response to field stimulation of the guinea-pig taenia coli.<1. The inhibitory potential evoked by field stimulation of the guineapig taenia coli was studied in hypertonic solution in which the spontaneous electrical and mechanical activity was slowed or abolished.2. There was no direct correlation between the inhibitory potential and the muscle membrane polarization in response to the stimulating current. The chronaxie for the inhibitory potential was less than 1 msec and that for the muscle spike 20-30 msec.3. The inhibitory potential decreased in size along the tissue when one end of the tissue was stimulated, but its spatial decay was slower than that of the electrotonic potential in the muscle bundle.4. Tetrodotoxin (5 x 10(-7) g/ml.) abolished the inhibitory potential without affecting the electrical properties of the muscle membrane. It was concluded that the inhibitory potential was the result of stimulation of intrinsic inhibitory nerves.5. The following properties of the intrinsic nerve fibres were deduced from the experimental results: The length of the nerve fibres is probably only a few mm and the space constant of the order of 0.1 mm. No repetitive firing is produced by a long current pulse. The absolute refractory period is 3-4 msec.<Animals, Colon, physiology, Electric Stimulation, Guinea Pigs, In Vitro Techniques, Muscle Contraction, drug effects, physiology, Muscle, Smooth, drug effects, physiology, Neural Conduction, physiology, Neuromuscular Junction, physiology, Tetrodotoxin, Toxins, Biological, pharmacology
16034116<Inhibition of gastrointestinal movement by sympathetic nerve stimulation: the site of action.<1. The mechanism of sympathetic nervous inhibition of gastrointestinal movement was investigated in order to determine whether the primary action of sympathetic nerve stimulation was on ganglia or on the smooth muscle itself.2. The effect of sympathetic nerve stimulation did not resemble the effect of ganglionic blockade or that of removing all nervous tone with tetrodotoxin.3. The same frequency of sympathetic nerve stimulation to the rabbit jejunum which inhibited the myogenic spontaneous activity blocked excitatory responses to transmural post-ganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation and antagonized contractions in response to drugs acting directly on the smooth muscle.4. Acetylcholine output was measured as an indicator of post-ganglionic nervous activity. In contrast to hexamethonium, stimulation of sympathetic nerves at frequencies of stimulation sufficient to relax the muscle did not reduce the output of acetylcholine.5. Vagus nerves and sympathetic nerves to the guinea-pig stomach were stimulated individually and simultaneously in the presence of hyoscine. The relaxant responses to stimulation of the two nerves summated when they were stimulated simultaneously, indicating that the transganglionic vagal pathway was not blocked.6. It is concluded that the effect of sympathetic nerve stimulation is due to the direct action of the released noradrenaline on the smooth muscle.<Acetylcholine, analysis, pharmacology, Animals, Biological Assay, Celiac Plexus, physiology, Electric Stimulation, Female, Gastrointestinal Motility, drug effects, physiology, Guinea Pigs, Hexamethonium Compounds, pharmacology, Histamine, pharmacology, Ileum, innervation, Intestine, Small, innervation, Jejunum, innervation, Male, Muscle Contraction, physiology, Muscle, Smooth, innervation, Norepinephrine, pharmacology, Physostigmine, pharmacology, Rabbits, Scopolamine, pharmacology, Stomach, innervation, Sympathetic Nervous System, physiology, Tetrodotoxin, pharmacology, Toxins, Biological, pharmacology, Vagus Nerve, physiology
16034117<The mechanism of body temperature changes induced by intraventricular injections of adrenaline, noradrenaline and 5-hydroxytryptamine in the ox (Bos taurus).<1. Adrenaline, noradrenaline and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) were injected into the lateral ventricle of the ox. The effect of these drugs was measured on the respiratory rate, tidal volume, heat production, skin temperature of the ear, evaporative loss from the skin and the rectal temperature at 20 and 10 degrees C ambient temperature.2. Neither adrenaline (3 mg) nor noradrenaline (3 mg) had any effect on the temperature regulating mechanisms of the ox, except to produce vasoconstriction if vasodilatation was already present due to high ambient temperature or previous injection of 5-HT.3. Injection of 5-HT (5 mg) caused a rise in respiratory rate, a fall in tidal volume and heat production, elevation of ear skin temperature and skin evaporative loss and a decrease in rectal temperature. Sedation of the animals occurred.4. In its reaction to these monoamines the ox is similar to the goat, sheep and rabbit, but is unlike the cat and dog.5. It was concluded that neither adrenaline nor noradrenaline has a role in the central control of temperature regulation in the ox, but that 5-HT may be involved in the control of heat dissipation mechanisms.<Animals, Body Temperature, Body Temperature Regulation, drug effects, Cattle, Cerebral Ventricles, drug effects, Epinephrine, pharmacology, Norepinephrine, pharmacology, Respiration, drug effects, Serotonin, pharmacology
16034118<The influence of conjugation of cholic acid on its uptake and secretion: hepatic extraction of taurocholate and cholate in the dog.<1. Sodium taurocholate or cholate was administered systemically at a constant rate of about 2.9 mumole/min.kg body wt. to anaesthetized dogs in which the common bile duct had been cannulated. In steady-state conditions blood was sampled from systemic and hepatic veins and the fraction of bile salt removed in a single passage through the liver was determined. Total hepatic blood flow was estimated by application of the Fick principle.2. The hepatic extraction fraction for synthetic taurocholate in ten experiments was 92%+/-5% (S.D.) over the blood flow range encountered (1.1-2.8 ml./min.g liver). The extraction of cholate extensively conjugated in the liver before excretion into bile was 79%+/-8% (S.D.) (twenty-one observations, thirteen experiments). In circumstances of similar hepatic blood flow the extraction of cholate transferred to bile in the free form (after acute taurine depletion) was significantly less than that of either synthetic taurocholate or cholate which could be actively conjugated before excretion. These results, which are discussed and criticized, support previous work on the advantage of conjugation in the transfer of cholic acid from blood to bile.3. The hepatic clearance of bile salt decreases with increasing administration rate, but the values obtained may be influenced by changes in hepatic blood flow. With regard to taurocholate an increase in total hepatic flow was observed when its administration rate exceeded about 5 mumole/min.kg body wt.4. The secretory maximum for glycocholate, a bile salt not normally found in dog bile, was of the same order as that for taurocholate.<Animals, Bile, analysis, Bile Acids and Salts, blood, metabolism, pharmacology, Dogs, Erythrocytes, metabolism, Liver, blood supply, metabolism, Regional Blood Flow, Taurine, metabolism
16034479<An electron microscope study of myofibril formation in embryonic chick skeletal muscle.<The formation of myofibrils in the developing leg muscle of the 12-day chick embryo was studied by electron microscopy. Myofilaments of two varieties, thick (160-170 A in diameter) and thin (60-70 A in diameter), which have been designated myosin and actin filaments, respectively, on the basis of their similarity to natural and synthetic myosin and actin filaments, appear in the cytoplasm of developing muscle cells. There is a greater than 7:1 ratio of thin to thick filaments in these young myofibers. The free myofilaments become aligned in the long axis of the cells, predominantly in subsarcolemmal locations, and aggregate into hexagonally packed arrays of filaments. The presence of Z band material or M band cross-bridges do not appear to be essential for the formation or spacing of these aggregates of filaments. Formation of the Z band lattices occurs coincidentally with the back-to-back apposition of thin filaments. An hypothesis concerning myofibril growth, based on the self-assembly characteristics of the filaments, is presented.<Animals, Chick Embryo, Cytoplasm, metabolism, Histocytochemistry, Microscopy, Electron, Muscle Proteins, analysis, Muscles, embryology, Myofibrils, embryology
16034480<Cholinesterase activity of nodal and internodal regions of myelinated nerve fibers of frog.<The distribution of cholinesterase (Ch-esterase) in isolated myelinated fibers of the frog has been investigated. Quantitative microgasometric measurements have confirmed the previous histochemical observations. Both approaches indicate that in frog nerve fibers acetylcholinesterase (ACh-esterase) is the only or the predominant enzyme when selective inhibitors and different substrates are used: acetylcholine (ACh), butyrylcholine, and acetyl-B-methylcholine (Mecholyl). By means of the microgasometric technique, a significant difference in ACh-esterase activity between axons isolated from ventral (37.2 +/- 1.7 micromole x 10(-5) ACh/mm(2)/hr) and dorsal roots (2.0 +/- 0.9 micromole x 10(-5) ACh/mm(2)/hr) was found. In the region of the node of Ranvier the enzyme activity (50.4 +/- 4.4 micromole x 10(-5) ACh/mm(2)/hr) appears to be considerably higher than in the internodal area (36.6 +/- 2.1 micromole x 10(-5) ACh/mm(2)/hr).

16034481<Development of fine structural damage to alveolar and capillary lining cells in oxygen-poisoned rat lungs.<Rats were exposed to 98.5% oxygen at 765 torr for 6-72 hr. The pulmonary changes were investigated by electron microscopy and by morphometric methods. A progressive thickening of the air-blood barrier, from the normal 1.5 to 3 micro after 3 days, was due primarily to enlargement of the interstitial space by accumulation of edema which was replaced secondarily by cells and fibrin. This was accompanied by destruction of about 50% of the capillaries. Morphometric data allowed an estimate of the degree of impairment of lung function. The primary cellular damage was located in endothelial cells which underwent cytoplasmic changes and, finally, fragmentation. In contrast, the damage to the epithelial lining of alveoli was relatively scarce compared to the extensive endothelial changes. This pertained even to severely damaged lungs with 65% of the alveoli obliterated by a heterogeneous exudate. Possible causes for this apparently different reaction of epithelium (the first target cell) and endothelium to toxic oxygen effects are discussed.<Animals, Capillaries, pathology, Connective Tissue, pathology, Epithelium, pathology, Exudates and Transudates, chemically induced, Fibrin, Hyperbaric Oxygenation, adverse effects, Lung, physiology, Male, Microscopy, Electron, Pulmonary Alveoli, pathology, Pulmonary Edema, chemically induced, Rats
16034482<Metabolic and morphological observations on the effect of surface-active agents of leukocytes.<Morphological and metabolic observations have been made on the effects of endotoxin, deoxycholate, and digitonin (at less than 50 microg/ml) on polymorphonuclear leukocytes and mononuclear cells. The agents stimulate the respiration and glucose oxidation of these cells in a manner similar to that seen during phagocytosis. Electron microscopy revealed no morphological changes with the first two agents, but dramatic membrane changes were seen in the case of digitonin. Here tubular projections of characteristic size and shape formed on and split off the membrane. All the agents stimulated uptake of inulin, but efforts to demonstrate increased pinocytosis by electron microscopy have not so far succeeded, probably due to limitations in present experimental techniques.<Animals, Bile Acids and Salts, pharmacology, Carbon Isotopes, Cell Membrane, drug effects, Cholesterol, pharmacology, Digitalis Glycosides, pharmacology, Endotoxins, pharmacology, Glucose, metabolism, Guinea Pigs, Inulin, metabolism, Leukocytes, cytology, drug effects, metabolism, Microscopy, Electron, Oxygen Consumption, drug effects, Phagocytosis, drug effects, Phospholipids, analysis, Phosphorus Isotopes, Pinocytosis, drug effects, Surface-Active Agents, pharmacology
16034483<Spermiogenesis in wild type and in a male sterility mutant of Drosophila melanogaster.<Spermiogenesis in the translocation heterozygote T (1; 2H) 25(20) y l 25/FM6 has been studied with the electron microscope and compared with that in wild type males. It appears that the genetic lesion in the male sterility mutant is associated primarily with a failure in differentiation of the head. In wild type flies, the spermatid nucleus assumes a conchoidal shape; chromatin accumulates along the convex surface. Adjacent to the concave surface a large bundle of microtubules runs parallel to the long axis of the spermatid. A single row of microtubules is juxtaposed against the convex surface of the head. As differentiation proceeds, the nucleus elongates, chromatin condenses, and the nucleus is compacted to a final diameter of about 0.3 micro. In the sterile mutant the spermatid nucleus has an irregular or wedge-shaped profile and no concavity is formed, nor is the bundle of microtubules observed. The row of microtubules, however, is usually present around the periphery. The change from lysine-rich to arginine-rich histone in mature wild type sperm does not occur in the sterile male. The substructure of the axial filament and mitochondrial derivatives, however, are similar to those in wild type.<Animals, Cell Differentiation, Cell Division, Drosophila, physiology, Histocytochemistry, Infertility, Male, Male, Microscopy, Microscopy, Electron, Mutation, Spermatozoa, growth &amp; development
16034484<Circadian phase relationships of thymidine-3H uptake, labeled nuclei, grain counts, and cell division rate in rat corneal epithelium.<Significant differences in the uptake of thymidine-(3)H, percentage of labeled cells, numbers of grains per labeled nucleus, and mitotic rate were noted in rat corneal epithelium along a 24-hr time scale. These were demonstrated by injecting subgroups of five animals every hour during a 24-hr period with thymidine-(3)H, sacrificing them 2 hr later, and analyzing the corneal epithelium by scintillation counter and radioautographic techniques. The increase in uptake during specific periods of the 24-hr time scale is attributed to an acceleration in the rate of DNA synthesis by individual cells and to an increase in the percentage of cells in the population actively synthesizing DNA.<Animals, Autoradiography, Cell Division, Cell Nucleus, metabolism, Circadian Rhythm, Cornea, metabolism, DNA, biosynthesis, Epithelium, metabolism, Male, Rats, Thymidine, metabolism, Tritium
16034485<The use of formaldehyde-treated 131-I-albumin in the study of digestive vacuoles and some properties of these particles from mouse liver.<The trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity released during incubation of mouse liver particles containing intravenously injected formaldehyde-treated (131)I-albumin consisted almost entirely of (131)I-iodotyrosine. The material was shown to be excreted into the medium and was not due to disruption of the particles by acid. Triton X-100 or the absence of sucrose in the medium inhibited hydrolysis of the particle-associated labeled protein. This inhibition was due to disruption of the digestive vacuoles and dilution of the protein and cathepsins in the suspending medium. These results and other experimental evidence strongly suggest that the (131)I-albumin-containing liver particles are digestive vacuoles. The results also establish that (131)I-albumin may be used to study these vacuoles. High concentrations of sucrose (1 M) inhibited degradation of intraparticulate protein. However, 1 M salts inhibited only the rate of the digestion. Sucrose had an inhibitory effect on a crude cathepsin preparation, and salts stimulated the activity when (131)I-albumin was used as substrate. The effect of high sucrose concentrations as an inhibitor of protein hydrolysis within digestive vacuoles was, therefore, most likely due principally to an inhibition of cathepsin activity within the vacuoles. The effect of salt was probably caused by a stimulation of both intra- and extra-particulate cathepsin activities, although 0.5-1.0 M KCl appeared to protect the particles.<Albumins, metabolism, Animals, Cathepsins, pharmacology, Chromatography, Ion Exchange, Formaldehyde, pharmacology, Iodine Radioisotopes, Liver, metabolism, Lysosomes, metabolism, Male, Mice, Potassium Chloride, pharmacology, Proteins, pharmacology, Sodium Chloride, pharmacology, Sucrose, pharmacology, Surface-Active Agents, pharmacology
16034486<Simultaneous synthesis of histone and DNA in synchronously dividing Tetrahymena pyriformis.<Histone and DNA syntheses have been studied in synchronously dividing Tetrahymena pyriformis GL. During the heat treatment necessary to synchronize cultures of this amicronucleate protozoan, the DNA content of the already polyploid macronucleus increases. When the cells begin synchronous division, their DNA content is reduced in a stepwise process which is closely paralleled by reduction of macronuclear histone content. During cell division, the contents of DNA and histone decrease by slightly more than twofold, and in the subsequent S phase, DNA and histone increase simultaneously to 85% of the values expected if all chromosomes were to double. The first step in the process of reduction of DNA and histone contents is their decrease in excess of twofold, and this is accomplished by removal of extrusion bodies from the nuclei of dividing cells. The second step is a mechanism which allows, in effect, only 70% of the chromatin in the average nucleus to duplicate. Such partial duplication suggests that both histone and DNA syntheses in synchronous Tetrahymena depend upon a regulatory mechanism, the mediating elements of which are localized in only certain chromosomes.<Cell Division, Cell Nucleus, analysis, DNA, biosynthesis, Electrophoresis, Histones, biosynthesis, Hot Temperature, Tetrahymena, metabolism
16034487<Studies on protein uptake by isolated tumor cells. 3. Apparent stimulations due to pH, hypertonicity, polycations, or dehydration and their relation to the enhanced penetration of infectious nucleic acids.<Fixation of (131)I-serum albumin by Ehrlich ascites tumor cells in suspensions and sarcoma S-180 monolayers was measured under experimental conditions. Anaerobic incubation and inhibitors of the oxidative metabolism critically restricted the range of glucose concentrations capable of supporting cell life; in glucose concentrations higher than 10(-2)M, Ehrlich cells suffered from their own acid production; in concentrations 10(-2)M, lower than they underwent damage by starvation. Both types of damage were accompanied by increased albumin fixation unrelated to pinocytosis. Different procedures recommended to enhance the uptake of infectious viral RNA by animal cells in culture were tested for their ability to increase albumin uptake. They enhanced the penetration of both albumin and vital dyes and decreased the viability of cell populations. Their effect, therefore, is related to cell damage. It was postulated that reversible damage to cells favors RNA infection by leading to abnormal uptake processes and by decreasing intracellular digestion. This abnormal uptake is different from pinocytosis and also from the massive fixation of albumin to dead cells. The latter phenomenon is due to adsorption by intracellular sites exposed by disruption of the cell membrane. Polycations are able to induce all three forms of fixation depending on the experimental conditions.<Adsorption, Animals, Biological Transport, drug effects, Carcinoma, Ehrlich Tumor, metabolism, Glucose, metabolism, Histones, pharmacology, Humans, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Hypertonic Solutions, pharmacology, Lymphocytes, drug effects, metabolism, Lymphoma, metabolism, Mice, Ornithine, pharmacology, Protamines, pharmacology, RNA, Viral, metabolism, Rats, Sarcoma 180, metabolism, Serum Albumin, Radio-Iodinated, metabolism
16034503<The role of calcium in the regulation of the steady-state levels of sodium and potassium in the HeLa cell.<Studies on HeLa cells in spinner culture at pH 7.0 and 37 degrees have shown that [Na](i) decreased and [K](i) increased with increasing [Ca](o). In Na-free (choline) medium [K](i) remained high whether or not Ca was present in the medium. [Na](i) and [K](i) approached a new steady state within 1 min after transfer to Ca-free medium and returned to the initial values within 15 min upon readdition of Ca. 40% of the cell Ca exchanged within 1 min followed by a slow exchange of the remaining Ca over several hours. [Ca](i) increased with decreasing [Na](o) but was independent of [K](o). Equimolar Mg did not substitute for Ca in maintaining low [Na](i) and high [K](i). Under steady-state conditions about 50% of the cell Na exchanged in accordance with a single rate constant. The initial Na influx was 270, 100, and 2.5 microM/liter of cell water/sec for 0, 0.10, and 1.0 mM [Ca](o), respectively. When Na transport was inhibited with strophanthidin and [Na](i) and [K](i) allowed to reach a steady state, Na influx was more rapid for cells incubated in Ca-free medium than for cells incubated in medium containing 1.0 mM Ca. These results suggest that Ca competes with Na at the cell membrane and thus controls the passive diffusion of Na into the cell.<Biological Transport, Calcium, pharmacology, Calcium Isotopes, Cell Membrane, Culture Media, Culture Techniques, HeLa Cells, Magnesium, metabolism, Potassium, metabolism, Sodium, metabolism, Sodium Isotopes
16034504<The formation and continuous turnover of a fraction of phosphatidic acid on stimulation of NaC1 secretion by acetylcholine in the salt gland.<Acetylcholine, which stimulates NaCl secretion in the avian salt gland, causes the rapid formation of a fraction of phosphatidic acid, as measured by (32)P incorporation, which amounts maximally to about 0.18 micromoles per g of fresh tissue. This does not appear to involve synthesis of the diglyceride moiety of phosphatidic acid, as measured by glycerol-1-(14)C incorporation. It presumably involves formation of phosphatidic acid by the diglyceride kinase pathway from preformed diglyceride and ATP. The specific activity of the AT(32)P of the tissue is not increased in the presence of acetylcholine. At time intervals after addition of acetylcholine during which a full response, measured as increased O(2) uptake, may be observed, phosphatidic acid appears to be the only phosphatide which shows any increase either in total (32)P radioactivity or in net specific acitvity. This responsive fraction of phosphatidic acid undergoes continuous turnover of its phosphate moiety. There is no evidence that this turnover is due to the phosphatidic acid acting as a pool of intermediate for the synthesis of other phospholipids or glycerides. The responsive fraction amounts to not more than 20% of the total phosphatidic acid of the tissue; it does not mix with the other (non-responsive) phosphatidic acid of the tissue.

16034505<Electrical properties of the pacemaker neurons in the heart ganglion of a stomatopod, Squilla oratoria.<In the Squilla heart ganglion, the pacemaker is located in the rostral group of cells. After spontaneous firing ceased, the electrophysiological properties of these cells were examined with intracellular electrodes. Cells respond to electrical stimuli with all-or-none action potentials. Direct stimulation by strong currents decreases the size of action potentials. Comparison with action potentials caused by axonal stimulation and analysis of time relations indicate that with stronger currents the soma membrane is directly stimulated whereas with weaker currents the impulse first arises in the axon and then invades the soma. Spikes evoked in a neuron spread into all other neurons. Adjacent cells are interconnected by electrotonic connections. Histologically axons are tied with the side-junction. B spikes of adjacent cells are blocked simultaneously by hyperpolarization or by repetitive stimulation. Experiments show that under such circumstances the B spike is not directly elicited from the A spike but is evoked by invasion of an impulse or electrotonic potential from adjacent cells. On rostral stimulation a small prepotential precedes the main spike. It is interpreted as an action potential from dendrites.<Action Potentials, Animals, Axons, Crustacea, physiology, Dendrites, Electric Stimulation, Electrophysiology, Ganglia, physiology, Heart Conduction System, physiology, Potentiometry
16034506<Pacemaker potentials for the periodic burst discharge in the heart ganglion of a stomatopod, Squilla oratoria.<From somata of the pacemaker neurons in the Squilla heart ganglion, pacemaker potentials for the spontaneous periodic burst discharge are recorded with intracellular electrodes. The electrical activity is composed of slow potentials and superimposed spikes, and is divided into four types, which are: (a) "mammalian heart" type, (b) "slow generator" type, (c) "slow grower" type, and (d) "slow deficient" type. Since axons which are far from the somata do not produce slow potentials, the soma and dendrites must be where the slow potentials are generated. Hyperpolarization impedes generation of the slow potential, showing that it is an electrically excitable response. Membrane impedance increases on depolarization. Brief hyperpolarizing current can abolish the plateau but brief tetanic inhibitory fiber stimulation is more effective for the abolition. A single stimulus to the axon evokes the slow potential when the stimulus is applied some time after a previous burst. Repetitive stimuli to the axon are more effective in eliciting the slow potential, but the depolarization is not maintained on continuous stimulation. Synchronization of the slow potential among neurons is achieved by: (a) the electrotonic connections, with periodic change in resistance of the soma membrane, (b) active spread of the slow potential, and (c) synchronization through spikes.<Animals, Axons, Crustacea, physiology, Dendrites, Electric Stimulation, Ganglia, physiology, Heart Conduction System, physiology, Potentiometry
16034508<The influence of ionic strength on potassium contractures and calcium movements in frog muscle.<Frog toe muscles were bathed in isotonic, sodium-free Tris chloride, methanesulfonate, or sulfate solutions containing sucrose or mannitol and varying in ionic strength from 0.006 to 0.291. By decreasing the ionic strength the curve relating the peak tension of the K contractures to the log [K] was reversibly shifted to lower [K]. Increasing the [Ca] from 1 to 4 mM almost abolished this effect. The resting uptake of (45)Ca was increased more than two times by decreasing the ionic strength from 0.125 to 0.039. It was not increased significantly by raising [Ca] from 1 to 4 mM at low or normal ionic strength. The additional uptake of (45)Ca during contractures provoked by 120 mM K was not significantly different at the two levels of ionic strength. The rate of emergence of (45)Ca from muscles loaded with (45)Ca at reduced ionic strength, was decreased. The effects of low ionic strength are discussed in terms of changes in the potential difference across a membrane with fixed negative charges on the outer surface.<Animals, Anura, Biological Transport, Calcium, metabolism, Calcium Isotopes, Cell Membrane, Chlorides, pharmacology, Ions, Mannitol, pharmacology, Muscle Contraction, Potassium, pharmacology, Potentiometry, Sucrose, pharmacology, Sulfonic Acids, pharmacology
16034509<Cation metabolism in relation to cell size in synchronously grown tissue culture cell.<In randomly grown tissue culture cells (mouse leukemic lymphoblast, L5178Y) the number, volume, and Na(+) and K(+) content increase as an exponential function with a doubling time of 11.3 hr. In synchronously grown cells the volume increase of the population and of single cells follows the same exponential function as in randomly grown cells. In contrast, the cation content fluctuates during a single cell cycle. About 1(1/2) hr after the cell division burst (at the beginning of the S period), a net loss of K(+) occurs for a period of about 1 hr amounting to about 20% of the total K. Over the next 5 to 6 hr, the deficit in K(+) is eliminated. The Na(+) content shows a double fluctuation. It falls during the cell division burst, rises when the K(+) content decreases, falls again when K(+) content rises, and then increases again before the next cell division burst. The net fluxes of both Na(+) and K(+) are very small compared to the unidirectional fluxes (less than 5%), thus small changes in the balance of influx and efflux account for the changes in cation content during the growth cycle. Both unidirectional fluxes increase dramatically (by a factor of two) about 2 hr after the cell division burst, and then remain constant until after the next cell division. The pattern of electrolyte regulation during cell division does not follow a simple function such as cell number, cell surface, or cell volume, but must be related to specific internal events in the cell.<Animals, Biological Transport, Cell Division, Clone Cells, Culture Techniques, Mathematics, Mice, Potassium, metabolism, Potassium Isotopes, Sodium, metabolism, Sodium Isotopes, Water-Electrolyte Balance
16034510<Hyperosmolarity and the net transport of nonelectrolytes in frog skin.<The permeability of frog skin to a series of nonelectrolytes (thiourea, urea, mannitol, and sucrose) under the influence of 2.5 times normal osmolarity in the outer bathing solution has been investigated. Although the flux of the tracer nonelectrolytes across the skin in either direction is greatly increased by hyperosmolarity, the influx is found to be increased to a significantly greater extent than the outflux. Flux ratios as high as 3:1 can be observed. The net inward movement of the nonelectrolyte proceeds in spite of a sizeable bulk flow of water in the opposite direction. Possible driving forces for this phenomenon are discussed.<Animals, Anura, Biological Transport, Carbon Isotopes, Dimethyl Sulfoxide, pharmacology, Erythritol, pharmacology, Mannitol, Osmosis, Skin Physiological Phenomena, Sucrose, Thiourea, Urea, Water-Electrolyte Balance
16034511<The mechanochemistry of cardiac muscle. I. The isometric contraction.<The utilization of creatine phosphate (CP) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) was studied in the iodoacetate (IAA) and nitrogen (N(2))-treated cat papillary muscle. Under these conditions the net production of ATP does not occur, and the net utilization of ATP is reflected in a fall in CP concentration. The rate of energy utilization of the IAA-N(2)-treated cat papillary muscle resting without tension was 0.68 micromole CP/g/min. This rate was increased to 1.07 micromole/g/min when muscles were passively stretched with 2 g of tension. In a series of isometrically contracting muscles CP utilization was found to be proportional to the number of activations and the summated contractile element work. These rates of CP utilization were 0.083 micromole/g/activation and 0.0059 micromole/g-cm of work. The calculated mechanochemical coupling efficiency was 33%.<Adenosine Triphosphate, metabolism, Animals, Cats, Iodoacetates, pharmacology, Mathematics, Muscle Contraction, Nitrogen, pharmacology, Papillary Muscles, metabolism, physiology, Phosphocreatine, metabolism
16034512<Discrimination between alkali metal cations by yeast. II. Cation interactions in transport.<K(+) is a competitive inhibitor of the uptake of the other alkali metal cations by yeast. Rb(+) is a competitive inhibitor of K(+) uptake, but Li(+), Na(+), and Cs(+) act like H(+). At relatively low concentrations they behave as apparent noncompetitive inhibitors of K(+) transport, but the inhibition is incomplete. At higher concentrations they inhibit the remaining K(+) transport competitively. Ca(++) and Mg(++) in relatively low concentrations partially inhibit K(+) transport in an apparently noncompetitive manner although their affinity for the transport site is very low. In each case, in concentrations that produce "noncompetitive" inhibition, very little of the inhibiting cation is transported into the cell. Competitive inhibition is accompanied by appreciable uptake of the inhibiting cation. The apparently noncompetitive effect of other cations is reversed by K(+) concentrations much higher than those necessary to essentially "saturate" the transport system. A model is proposed which can account for the inhibition kinetics. This model is based on two cation-binding sites for which cations compete, a carrier or transporting site, and a second nontransporting (modifier) site with a different array of affinities for cations. The association of certain cations with the modifier site leads to a reduction in the turnover of the carrier, the degree of reduction depending on the cation bound to the modifier site and on the cation being transported.<Biological Transport, Calcium, metabolism, Cesium, metabolism, Hydrogen, metabolism, Kinetics, Lithium, metabolism, Magnesium, metabolism, Mathematics, Models, Theoretical, Potassium, metabolism, Rubidium, metabolism, Saccharomyces, metabolism, Sodium, metabolism
16034513<Cation interdiffusion in squid giant axons.<Radiotracer techniques were used to study the influxes and effluxes of various univalent cations in internally perfused squid giant axons. Membrane currents and conductances were determined by the voltage-clamp technique under analogous internal and external conditions. Both sodium-containing and sodium-free internal and external media were studied. Membrane impedance was measured with an ac impedance bridge to determine the general magnitude and time course of the impedance loss which accompanied the excitation process in both varieties of external media. Maximum transmembrane currents were found to be of comparable magnitude to the charge transfer associated with the peak interdiffusion flux measured under the same conditions. The product of the membrane resistance and the interdiffusion flux remained constant over a wide range of resistance and flux values, both at rest and during activity, both in sodium-containing and sodium-free media. The implications of these findings for excitation theory are discussed.<Animals, Axons, physiology, Cell Membrane Permeability, Culture Media, Electrophysiology, Guanidines, metabolism, Mollusca, Potassium, metabolism, Potassium Isotopes, Radioisotopes, Rubidium, metabolism, Sodium, metabolism
16034749<Immunization of dissociated spleen cell cultures from normal mice.<A culture system for cell suspensions from mouse spleens has been described. The system provides adequate conditions for in vitro immunization on initial exposure to heterologous erythrocytes. The in vitro response closely parallels that observed in vivo with respect to size, early kinetics, antigen dose, and the inhibitory effect of passive antibody. The response of cultured cells differs in two respects from that seen in vivo. There is an increase in the ability to discriminate between different varieties of homologous erythrocytes and the in vitro response does not appear to be limited by whatever mechanisms regulate the in vivo response.<Animals, Antibody Formation, Antigens, pharmacology, Blood, Cattle, Culture Media, Culture Techniques, Erythrocytes, Fetus, Goats, Hemolysin Proteins, biosynthesis, Horses, Immune Sera, pharmacology, Mice, Oxygen, pharmacology, Perissodactyla, Sheep, Spleen, cytology, Swine
16034750<Cell populations and cell proliferation in the in vitro response of normal mouse spleen to heterologous erythrocytes. Analysis by the hot pulse technique.<The role of proliferation in the development of 19S antibody-forming cells in the primary response has been investigated in an in vitro system. Spleen cell suspensions from normal, unimmunized mice were cultured in vitro in the presence of mammalian erythrocytes and the number of 19S hemolytic plaque-forming cells that arose 4 days later was measured. The hot pulse technique for the selective irradiation of those cells which synthesize DNA during a defined period of time has been described. The effect of such hot pulses administered at various times after the addition of antigen on the subsequent appearance of antibody-forming cells was determined. The results established that: (a) the onset of DNA synthesis does not start for approximately 24-32 hr after the addition of antigen, (b) essentially all the antibody-forming cells arise by cell division, and (c) different cell populations are involved in the response to two non-cross-reacting antigens.<Animals, Antibody Formation, Antigens, pharmacology, Cell Division, Culture Techniques, DNA, biosynthesis, Erythrocytes, Hemolysin Proteins, biosynthesis, Mice, Spleen, cytology, Thymidine, metabolism, Tritium
16034751<Streptococcal nucleases. I. Further studies on the A, B, and C enzymes.<Streptococcal DNAse C is more resistant to heat inactivation than the A or B enzyme. DNAses A and C are indifferent to the bacterial ribonucleic acid inhibitor whereas the B enzyme is markedly inhibited. Prolonged digestion with relatively large amounts of DNAse B results in chemical and biological destruction of the inhibitor. Ribonuclease as well as deoxyribonuclease activity is associated with the B enzyme. Both activities require divalent cations and both are inhibited by bacterial ribonucleic acid. The ratios of the two activities are constant in various preparations and after partial heat inactivation. Mutual inhibition of the two activities can be demonstrated in mixed substrate systems. The evidence presented is consistent with the view that the B enzyme is a single nuclease which can attack both deoxyribonucleic and ribonucleic acids.<Calcium, Chromatography, Ion Exchange, Cobalt, DNA, Bacterial, analysis, metabolism, Deoxyribonucleases, metabolism, Electrophoresis, Hot Temperature, Magnesium, Manganese, RNA, Bacterial, analysis, metabolism, Ribonucleases, metabolism, Streptococcus, enzymology, Viscosity
16034752<The relationship of polymorphonuclear leukocytes to infertility in uteri containing foreign bodies.<A chronic infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes was invariably found in the infertile regions of uteri containing foreign bodies in conventional rats, germfree rats, mice, and rabbits. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes were never found in the fertile regions of these uteri. A foreign body in the uterus of the rat, and probably also the mouse, was associated with a bacterial infection which spread the inflammatory response throughout the horn containing the foreign body, and in the mouse occasionally into the control horn as well. No bacteria could be cultured from the rabbit uterine horn containing a foreign body. In the germfree rat, both the infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes into the uterus and fertility were significantly different from that observed in the conventional rat. Whereas in the conventional rat the inflammation and infertility extended along the entire length of the uterine horn containing a small foreign body, in the germfree rat the inflammation and infertility were closely correlated to the position of the foreign body. As judged by measurements of lysozyme in the uterine lumens of rats and rabbits, polymorphonuclear leukocytes released their contents into solution in the uterine lumen. It is concluded that some substance derived from polymorphonuclear leukocytes may exert toxic effects on fertilized ova or on spermatozoa and thus be responsible for the infertility of uteri containing foreign bodies.<Animals, Culture Techniques, Female, Foreign Bodies, Germ-Free Life, Infertility, Female, etiology, Inflammation, etiology, Intrauterine Devices, Mice, Muramidase, analysis, Neutrophils, Rabbits, Rats, Uterus, enzymology
16034753<Temperature effects on pacemaker generation, membrane potential, and critical firing threshold in Aplysia neurons.<Temperature increases cause a regular and reproducible increase in the frequency of generation of pacemaker potentials in most Aplysia neurons specialized for this type of activity which can only be explained as a direct stimulating effect of temperature upon the ionic mechanisms responsible for pacemaker potentials. At the same time all cells in the visceral ganglion undergo a membrane potential hyperpolarization of approximately 1-2 mv/ degrees C warmed. In spite of the marked variation in resting membrane potential the critical firing threshold remains at a constant membrane potential level at all temperatures in the absence of accommodative changes. The temperature-frequency curves of all types of cells are interpreted as a result of the interaction between the effects of temperature on the pacemaker-generating mechanism and resting membrane potential. Previous observations on the effects of temperature on excitability of mammalian neurons suggest that other types of neurons may undergo similar marked shifts in resting membrane potential with temperature variation.<Action Potentials, physiology, Animals, Ganglia, physiology, Heart Conduction System, innervation, physiology, Membrane Potentials, physiology, Mollusca, physiology, Synapses, Temperature
16034754<The effect of low ionic strength extracellular solutions on the resting potential in skeletal muscle fibers.<Intracellular measurements of the resting potential were made in fibers of the frog sartorius muscle in solutions of varying salt composition and concentration to determine the effects of low ionic strength extracellular solutions on the resting potential. Changes in the glass microelectrode tip potential in low ionic strength solutions were minimized by adding ThCl(4) to the extracellular solution. These experimental conditions allowed measurement of the relationship of the resting potential to the concentration of the salt in the extracellular solution by replacing it with the nonionic substance, sucrose. Substitution of sucrose for the extracellular NaCl produced a stable depolarization which was logarithmically related to the NaCl concentration. Substitution of sucrose for choline Cl, instead of NaCl, produced the same degree of depolarization. When Na salts of anions less permeable than chloride (Br, I, NO(3)) were used, the resting potentials in 116 mM solutions were close to those with chloride (+/-3mv). The depolarizations produced in low ionic strength solutions of these salts were significantly less than those with chloride.<Animals, Anura, Bromides, pharmacology, Choline, pharmacology, Electrophysiology, Iodides, pharmacology, Muscles, drug effects, physiology, Nitrates, pharmacology, Sodium Chloride, pharmacology, Sucrose, pharmacology, Thorium, pharmacology
16034755<Removal of potassium negative resistance in perfused squid giant axons.<Squid giant axons, internally and externally perfused with solutions having potassium as the only cation, exhibit an approximately linear steady-state current-voltage relation. When small amounts of calcium and magnesium are present in the external potassium solution, the current-voltage curve is markedly nonlinear, exhibiting the rectification and negative resistance which have been observed for intact axons in isosmotic potassium solutions. The effects of perfusion and removal of external divalent cations are interpreted in terms of two components of current, a linear component and a nonlinear time-varying component. The former is increased and the latter diminished by the removal of the external divalent cations.<Animals, Axons, physiology, Calcium, pharmacology, Electrophysiology, instrumentation, Magnesium, pharmacology, Membrane Potentials, physiology, Mollusca, physiology, Perfusion, Potassium, pharmacology
16034756<Cation regulation in the smooth muscle of frog stomach.<Cation composition of frog smooth muscle cells was investigated. Fresh stomach muscle rings resembled skeletal muscle, but marked Na gain and K loss followed immersion. Mean Na (49.8-79.7 mM/kg tissue) and K (61.8-80.1 mM/kg tissue) varied between batches, but were stable for long periods in vitro. Exchange of 6-30 mM Na/kg tissue with (22)Na was extremely slow and distinct. Extracellular water was estimated from sucrose-(14)C uptake. Calculated exchangeable intracellular Na was 9 mM/kg cell water, and varied little. Thus steady-state transmembrane cation gradients appeared to be steep. K-free solution had only slight effects. Ouabain (10(-4)M) caused marked Na gain and reciprocal K loss; at 30 degrees C, Na and K varied linearly with time over a wide range of contents, indicating constant net fluxes. Net fluxes decreased with temperature decrease. (22)Na exchange in ouabain-treated tissue at 20-30 degrees C was rapid and difficult to analyze. The best minimum estimates of unidirectional Na fluxes at 30 degrees C were 10-12 times the constant net flux; constant pump efflux may explain these findings. The rapidity of Na exchange may not reflect very high permeability, but it does require a high rate of transport work.<Animals, Anura, Biological Transport, Active, Carbon Isotopes, Cell Membrane Permeability, Electrophysiology, Gastric Mucosa, metabolism, Muscle, Smooth, drug effects, metabolism, Ouabain, pharmacology, Potassium, metabolism, Sodium, metabolism, Sodium Isotopes, Sucrose, metabolism
16034757<Osmotic properties of mitochondria.<The osmotic behavior of rat liver mitochondria has been studied in a sucrose medium. The mitochondria behave like a two compartment system. One compartment is permeable to sucrose and has a volume of 1.22 microl/(mg mitochondrial dry weight) in a 272 milliosmol sucrose medium; the second, inaccessible to sucrose, has a volume of 0.555 microl/mg dry weight) under the same conditions. Part of the water in the sucrose inaccessible space is apparently not free to participate in osmotic phenomena. This volume is 0.272 microl/(mg dry weight) under the same conditions. It is suggested that the osmotically inactive water corresponds to the water of hydration of the mitochondrial macromolecules. The volume of the remainder of the water in the sucrose inaccessible space depends inversely on the osmolality of the medium, as is to be expected. The volume of water in the sucrose accessible space is constant, independent of the osmolality of the medium, as is the volume of the mitochondrial framework plus the nonvolatile solutes.<Animals, Mitochondria, physiology, Osmosis, Rats, Sucrose, metabolism, pharmacology
16034758<Decreased K+ conductance produced by Ba++ in frog sartorius fibers.<The action of Ba(++) on membrane potential (E(m)) and resistance (R(m)) of frog (R. pipiens) sartorius fibers was studied. In normal Cl(-) Ringer's, Ba(++) (&lt;9 mM) did not depolarize or induce contractions, but increased R(m) slightly above the control value of 3.8 +/- 0.6 K ohm-cm(2). In Cl(-)-free Ringer's (methane sulfonate) R(m) was 28.8 +/- 2.8 K ohm-cm(2), and low concentrations of Ba(++) (0.05-5.0 mM) depolarized and induced spontaneous contractions (fibrillation), even in tetrodotoxin. To stop disturbance of the microelectrodes, contractions were prevented by using two Cl(-)-free solutions: (a) twice hypertonic with sucrose (230 mM), or (b) high K(+) (83 mM) partially replacing Na(+). In the hypertonic solution, the fiber diameters decreased, E(m) increased slightly, and R(m) decreased to 9.0 +/- 0.6 K ohm-cm(2) (perhaps due to swelling of sarcotubules). Ba(++) (0.5 mM) rapidly increased R(m) to 31.3 +/- 3.8, decreased E(m) (e.g., to -30 mv), and induced spontaneous "action potentials;" Sr(++) had no effect. In the high K(+) solution, the fibers were nearly completely depolarized, and R(m) was decreased markedly to 1.5 +/- 0.2 K ohm-cm(2); Ba(++) increased R(m) to 6.7 +/- 0.5 K ohm-cm(2). The Ba(++) actions usually began within 0.5 min and reached a maximum within 5 min. Addition of SO(4) (=), to precipitate the Ba(++), rapidly reversed the increase in R(m). Ba(++) must act by decreasing K(+) conductance (g(K)). In Cl(-) Ringer's, the high g(Cl)/g(K) ratio masked the effect of Ba(++) on g(K). Thus, small concentrations of Ba(++) specifically and rapidly decrease g(K).<Action Potentials, drug effects, Animals, Anura, Barium, pharmacology, Chlorides, pharmacology, Electrophysiology, Membrane Potentials, drug effects, Muscle Contraction, drug effects, Muscles, drug effects, physiology, Potassium, metabolism, Strontium, pharmacology, Sucrose, pharmacology, Tetrodotoxin, pharmacology
16034759<Effects of cardiac glycosides on electrical activity in the isolated retina of the frog.<Ouabain added to physiological salt solutions bathing the isolated frog retina irreversibly abolishes the electrical response to light (the electroretinogram or ERG). The time course of abolition depends on the concentration of ouabain in the medium and the surface of the retina to which it is applied. When the glycoside is placed on the receptor surface, in 7 min the ERG is completely eliminated by 10(-4)M ouabain and more than 90% inhibited by 3 x 10(-5)M ouabain. The effect is slower at lower concentrations and when the solution is applied to the vitreous surface of the retina. The evidence suggests that abolition of the ERG by ouabain is due principally to inhibition of the active transport of sodium: (a) Structurally modified glycosides which are considerably less potent inhibitors of alkali cation-activated ATPase activity in preparations of frog retinal outer segments are also poorer inhibitors of electrical activity in isolated retinas. (b) Replacing much of the sodium in the medium bathing the retina by choline, Tris, or sucrose significantly protects the retina from ouabain. It is suggested that in a standard sodium environment essentially constant activity of the sodium pump is required to prevent rapid and irreversible change. The cellular sites most critically dependent on the sodium pump have not been identified.<Adenosine Triphosphate, pharmacology, Animals, Anura, Biological Transport, Active, drug effects, Cardiac Glycosides, pharmacology, Choline, pharmacology, Electroretinography, Light, Ouabain, pharmacology, Retina, drug effects, physiology, Sodium, metabolism, Sucrose, pharmacology
16034760<Ion transport in Hydrodictyon africanum.<The concentrations of K, Na, and Cl in the cytoplasm and vacuole, the tracer fluxes of these ions into and out of the cenocyte, and the electrical potential difference between bathing solution and vacuole and cytoplasm, have been measured in Hydrodictyon africanum. If the ions were acted on solely by passive electrochemical forces, a net efflux of K and Cl and a net influx of Na would be expected. Tracer fluxes indicate a net influx of K and Cl and efflux of Na in the light; these net fluxes are consequently active, with an obligate link to metabolism. The effects of darkness and low temperature indicate that most of the tracer K and Cl influx and Na efflux are linked to metabolism, while the corresponding tracer fluxes in the direction of the free energy gradient are not. Ouabain specifically inhibits the metabolically linked portions of tracer K influx and Na efflux. Alterations in the external K concentration have similar effects on metabolically mediated K influx and Na efflux. It would appear that K influx and Na efflux are linked, at least in the light.<Biological Transport, Active, physiology, Chlorides, metabolism, Cytoplasm, Cytoplasmic Granules, Darkness, Electrophysiology, Eukaryota, physiology, Light, Membrane Potentials, physiology, Ouabain, pharmacology, Photosynthesis, Potassium, metabolism, Sodium, metabolism, Temperature, Water-Electrolyte Balance, physiology
16034761<Light stimulation of active transport in Hydrodictyon africanum.<The mechanism of light stimulation of active K and Cl influx and active Na efflux, in Hydrodictyon africanum has been investigated using different wavelengths of red light and different gas mixtures, and the inhibitors DCMU and CCCP. The active Cl influx requires photosystem 2, since its relative quantal efficiency falls with increasing wavelength of red light, and it is as sensitive to the inhibitor DCMU as is photosynthesis; it is relatively insensitive to the uncoupler CCCP. The active K influx and active Na efflux are inhibited by CCCP, but the relative quantal efficiency of these processes increases with increasing wavelength of red light, and they are relatively insensitive to DCMU. These cation fluxes can be supported by cyclic photophosphorylation, whereas Cl influx needs photosystem 2 but probably not ATP.<Biological Transport, Active, physiology, Carbon Dioxide, metabolism, Carbon Isotopes, Chlorides, metabolism, Eukaryota, metabolism, Light, Photosynthesis, Potassium, metabolism, Potassium Isotopes, Sodium, metabolism, Sodium Isotopes, Urea, pharmacology
16034762<Factors influencing glucose flux and the effect of insulin in cultured human cells.<Uptake of glucose-(3)H into cultured HLM cells was measured. Equilibration of intracellular and extracellular pools occurred after 25 min. Glucose influx was determined subsequently by measuring the glucose-(3)H entering in precisely 1 min. Although saturation kinetics were demonstrated these were not of the simple Michaelis-Menten type. The K(m) of the glucose carrier system is probably about 60 mM glucose. Galactose did not compete with glucose. Insulin stimulated glucose flux without increasing the value of V(max). The stimulation was fully demonstrable after 10 min, could be elicited at concentrations of 10(-4) units/ml, and was absent 2-4 hr after removal. Increasing pH had little or no effect in stimulating glucose flux. Increasing osmotic pressure caused a marked increase and reduced the effect of insulin. Glucose influx was unaffected by anoxia. Glucose influx was increased and the effect of insulin abolished in the absence of K(+). Glucose influx was increased by mercuric chloride, iodoacetate, and fluoride which abolished the effect of insulin. Dinitrophenol decreased the rate of glucose uptake but did not alter the effect of insulin. Phlorizin reduced the rate of glucose uptake and abolished the effect of insulin. ATP and AMP enhanced the rate of glucose uptake. These findings are discussed in relation to the mode of action of insulin.<Adenine Nucleotides, pharmacology, Adenosine Triphosphate, pharmacology, Culture Techniques, Dinitrophenols, pharmacology, Fluorides, pharmacology, Galactose, metabolism, Glucose, metabolism, Humans, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Insulin, pharmacology, Iodoacetates, pharmacology, Kinetics, Mercury, pharmacology, Osmosis, Phlorhizin, pharmacology, Potassium, metabolism, Tritium
16034763<The spectral distribution of firefly light. II.<The in vivo peak emission wavelengths of bioluminescence are reported for 15 species of American fireflies. A spectrophotometric study of the dorsal light organs of 155 specimens of the Jamaican firefly Pyrophorus plagiophthalamus showed three distinct color distributions with peak emission wavelengths at 550.1 +/- 1.5 mmicro, 556.8 +/- 1.4 mmicro, and 562.4 +/- 1.0 mmicro. Similar spectral measurements of 35 ventral light organs of the same insects gave peak emission wavelengths ranging from 547 through 594 mmicro. This is a wider distribution than the total range of all 34 species of firefly studied to date. There was no obvious correlation between the colors of the ventral and dorsal light organs. It appears that P. plagiophthalamus is a special case in which the luciferase enzyme is not only different among members of the same species, but it may be different for the dorsal and ventral light organs in a single individual. A minimum of six different luciferase molecules for P. plagiophthalamus ventral light organs is proposed. The statistical precision in making these spectrophotometric measurements is discussed.<Animals, Enzymes, metabolism, Insecta, enzymology, physiology, Luciferases, metabolism, Luminescent Measurements, Spectrophotometry
16034764<Oxygen poisoning in Drosophila.<Fruit flies live longer at the partial pressure of oxygen found in air than at either larger or smaller partial pressures. Flies exposed to 1 atm of oxygen for 8 hr every day do not recover completely in the remaining 16 hr. In general, intermittent exposures to 1 atm of oxygen are better tolerated than continuous exposure to the same average oxygen concentration per day, but exposures to higher pressures of 2-5 atm of oxygen for as little as a half hour every two days markedly shorten the life-span. Older flies consume more oxygen per minute and are more sensitive to oxygen poisoning than young flies, and the rate of dying in 6 atm of O(2), or the reciprocal of the survival time, is a linear function of the age. The oxygen pressure-time curve can be well expressed by the general empirical equation (P(OO2))(2) x time = 120 where P is in atmosphere and survival time in hours. The progress of oxygen poisoning appears to be linear with time rather than exponential.<Aging, Animals, Drosophila, drug effects, Female, Male, Oxygen, toxicity, Partial Pressure
16034765<The formation and properties of thin lipid membranes from HK and LK sheep red cell lipids.<Lipids were obtained from high potassium (HK) and low potassium (LK) sheep red cells by sequential extraction of the erythrocytes with isopropanol-chloroform, chloroform-methanol-0.1 M KCl, and chloroform. The extract contained cholesterol and phospholipid in a molar ratio of 0.8:1.0, and less than 1% protein contaminant. Stable thin lipid membranes separating two aqueous compartments were formed from an erythrocyte lipid-hydrocarbon solution, and had an electrical resistance of approximately 10(8) ohm-cm(2) and a capacitance of 0.38-0.4 microf/cm(2). From the capacitance values, membrane thickness was estimated to be 46-132 A, depending on the assumed value for the dielectric constant (2.0-4.5). Membrane voltage was recorded in the presence of ionic (NaCl and/or KCl) concentration gradients in the solutions bathing the membrane. The permeability of the membrane to Na(+), K(+), and Cl(-) (expressed as the transference number, T(ion)) was computed from the steady-state membrane voltage and the activity ratio of the ions in the compartments bathing the membrane. T(Na) and T(K) were approximately equal ( approximately 0.8) and considerably greater than T(Cl) ( approximately 0.2). The ionic transference numbers were independent of temperature, the hydrocarbon solvent, the osmolarity of the solutions bathing the membranes, and the cholesterol content of the membranes, over the range 21-38 degrees C.

Under steady-state conditions, the nontransient component of (42)K influx was found to be 0.18 +/- 0.01 meq/liter RBC/hr and insensitive to ouabain (100 microM); the corresponding value for (24)Na was 17 +/- meq/liter RBC/hr. A study was made of the effects of anions upon cation movements in these and other mammalian red cells. Iodide was found to inhibit markedly (&gt;50%) Na inward movements in cat and dog but not in the other erythrocytes. An increase (15-30%) in K uptake in the presence of iodide was noted in all the mammalian cells studied.<Animals, Biological Transport, Active, physiology, Cats, Cell Membrane Permeability, drug effects, Dogs, Erythrocytes, metabolism, Iodides, pharmacology, Models, Theoretical, Ouabain, pharmacology, Potassium, metabolism, Potassium Isotopes, Rabbits, Sheep, Sodium, metabolism, Sodium Isotopes
16034767<Water permeability of thin lipid membranes.<The osmotic permeability coefficient, P(f), and the tagged water permeability coefficient, P(d), were determined for thin (&lt;100 A) lipid membranes formed from ox brain lipids plus DL-alpha-tocopherol; their value of approximately 1 x 10(-3) cm/sec is within the range reported for plasma membranes. It was established that P(f) = P(d). Other reports that P(f) &gt; P(d) can be attributed to the presence of unstirred layers in the experimental determination of P(d). Thus, there is no evidence for the existence of aqueous pores in these thin phospholipid membranes. The adsorption onto the membrane of a protein that lowers its electrical resistance by a factor of 10(3) was found not to affect its water permeability; however, glucose and sucrose were found to interact with the membrane to modify P(f). Possible mechanisms of water transport across these films are discussed, together with the implications of data obtained on these structures for plasma membranes.<Adsorption, Animals, Biological Transport, physiology, Brain Chemistry, Cattle, Cell Membrane Permeability, physiology, Glucose, metabolism, Membrane Potentials, physiology, Membranes, Artificial, Osmosis, Permeability, Phospholipids, metabolism, Proteins, Sucrose, metabolism, Vitamin E, metabolism, Water-Electrolyte Balance, physiology
16034768<The equivalent circuit of single crab muscle fibers as determined by impedance measurements with intracellular electrodes.<The input impedance of muscle fibers of the crab was determined with microelectrodes over the frequency range 1 cps to 10 kc/sec. Care was taken to analyze, reduce, and correct for capacitive artifact. One dimensional cable theory was used to determine the properties of the equivalent circuit of the membrane admittance, and the errors introduced by the neglect of the three dimensional spread of current are discussed. In seven fibers the equivalent circuit of an element of the membrane admittance must contain a DC path and two capacitances, each in series with a resistance. In two fibers, the element of membrane admittance could be described by one capacitance in parallel with a resistance. In several fibers there was evidence for a third very large capacitance. The values of the elements of the equivalent circuit depend on which of several equivalent circuits is chosen. The circuit (with a minimum number of elements) that was considered most reasonably consistent with the anatomy of the fiber has two branches in parallel: one branch having a resistance R(e) in series with a capacitance C(e); the other branch having a resistance R(b) in series with a parallel combination of a resistance R(m) and a capacitance C(m). The average circuit values (seven fibers) for this model, treating the fiber as a cylinder of sarcolemma without infoldings or tubular invaginations, are R(e) = 21 ohm cm(2); C(e) = 47 microf/cm(2); R(b) = 10.2 ohm cm(2); R(m) = 173 ohm cm(2); C(m) = 9.0 microf/cm(2). The relation of this equivalent circuit and another with a nonminimum number of circuit elements to the fine structure of crab muscle is discussed. In the above equivalent circuit R(m) and C(m) are attributed to the sarcolemma; R(e) and C(e), to the sarcotubular system; and R(b), to the amorphous material found around crab fibers. Estimates of actual surface area of the sarcolemma and sarcotubular system permit the average circuit values to be expressed in terms of unit membrane area. The values so expressed are consistent with the dielectric properties of predominantly lipid membranes.<Animals, Crustacea, physiology, Electrophysiology, instrumentation, Membrane Potentials, physiology, Models, Theoretical, Muscles, physiology, Sarcolemma, physiology
16034769<Is the cell membrane a universal rate-limiting barrier to the movement of water between the living cell and its surrounding medium?<With the use of a newly introduced technique, the "influx profile analysis," we studied the diffusion of tritiated water in and out of frog ovarian eggs at 25 degrees C. The results show that the rate-limiting step in the exchange of labeled water is not permeation through the cell membrane but diffusion in the bulk of the intracellular water.<Animals, Anura, Biological Transport, physiology, Cell Membrane, physiology, Cell Membrane Permeability, physiology, Computers, Tritium, Water-Electrolyte Balance, physiology
16035040<Independent measurement of ampicillin and cloxacillin in mixtures.<A simplified method of assaying mixtures of ampicillin and cloxacillin is presented. The method consists of cylinder-plate assays of appropriately diluted samples in three assay systems in which: (i) cloxacillin is measured, utilizing agar seeded with a penicillinase-producing Staphylococcus aureus; (ii) ampicillin is measured after the greatest dilution practicable, by use of agar seeded with Sarcina lutea; and (iii) the proportion of activity found in the second assay that remains after treatment with staphylococcal penicillinase is determined on agar seeded with S. lutea. The error was 4% or less when each system was run in quadruplicate, except when there was 10 or more times as much cloxacillin as ampicillin, in which case the greatest error was 12%. Mixtures of methicillin with benzylpenicillin or with ampicillin can also be quantitated by this method.<Ampicillin, analysis, Biological Assay, Cloxacillin, analysis, Methicillin, analysis, Penicillin G, analysis, Penicillinase, metabolism, Sarcina, metabolism, Staphylococcus, metabolism
16035041<Effect of food additives and irradiation on survival of Salmonella in oysters.<Salmonella typhimurium and S. enteritidis were inoculated into blended oysters, both raw and autoclaved. The oysters were also treated with sodium benzoate (0.1%) or potassium sorbate (0.1%), and irradiated (0.1 Mrad). In both non-irradiated and irradiated samples, greater numbers of Salmonella were recovered after storage at 7 C in the presence of sodium benzoate or potassium sorbate. The results of the autoclaved samples and studies in buffer indicated that this effect was not due to the reduction of competition from the natural flora when the additives were present.<Animals, Benzoates, pharmacology, Fatty Acids, pharmacology, Food Irradiation, Food Preservation, Salmonella, drug effects, Shellfish
16035042<Characterization of purified staphylococcal lipase.<Purified staphylococcal lipase had an optimal pH of 8.3 for activity at 37 C, and an optimal temperature of 45 C at pH 8.0. During storage, the enzyme lost less than 10% of the activity over a period of 21 days at 4 and -23 C. The enzyme retained 93% of the activity when heated for 30 min at 50 C and was 95% destroyed in 30 min at 70 C. The purified lipase was capable of hydrolyzing a variety of natural fats and oils. However, the enzyme was three times more active on nonhydrogenated soybean oil than on hydrogenated soybean oil with an iodine value of &lt;3.0. The enzyme was also capable of hydrolyzing fatty acids on the alpha, beta, and alpha' positions of a synthetic mixed triglyceride. In general, the presence of oxidizing agents increased the activity and the presence of reducing agents decreased the activity of the lipase enzyme.<Fats, metabolism, Fatty Acids, metabolism, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Lipase, analysis, metabolism, Staphylococcus, enzymology, Temperature
16035043<Resistivity of spores to ultraviolet and gamma radiation while exposed to ultrahigh vacuum or at atmospheric pressure.<Viability studies were conducted on microbial spores subjected to ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) in the 10(-9) to 10(-10) torr range. After 5 to 7 days in vacuum, they were exposed to ultraviolet (UV) or to gamma radiation either while still under vacuum or in the presence of dried air. Among the four test organisms subjected to UHV and ultraviolet radiation, Aspergillus niger was the most resistant; Bacillus megaterium, B. subtilis var. niger, and B. stearothermophilus were about equally less resistant. All four spores were more sensitive to ultraviolet radiation when UHV-dried than when desiccant-dried. Of the four test organisms subjected to UHV and gamma radiation, B. megaterium proved to be the most resistant; A. niger was the least resistant; and the remaining two organisms were of intermediate resistivity. All four organisms were less radiation resistant when UHV-dried than when irradiated in their normally hydrated state, and all showed an increased radiosensitivity after vacuum drying when oxygen was present. In addition, spores of B. subtilis var. niger and A. niger were less radiosensitive when UHV-dried and irradiated in vacuum than when "wet" and irradiated in air, whereas the reverse relationship was observed for the remaining two organisms. Based on the fact that microbial contaminants can be readily shielded from UV light by soils, metal particles, etc., and considering that the levels of ionizing radiations reported to be present in interstellar space are generally lower than those used in these experiments, the decrease in radioresistivity imparted by UHV drying is not of a sufficient magnitude to sterilize dependably portions of a spacecraft while on a mission.<Aspergillus, radiation effects, Bacillus, radiation effects, Cobalt Isotopes, Pressure, Radiation, instrumentation, Radiation Effects, Spores, Ultraviolet Rays
16035044<Influence of cations on spheroplasts of marine bacteria functioning as osmometers.<Penetration of substrates into marine bacteria as influenced by cations has been demonstrated by the effects of increased osmotic pressure in spheroplasts of these cells. Spheroplasts of Pseudomonas natriegens, stabilized with lactose, underwent a metabolic swelling in the presence of a substrate to which they had been induced. Maximal and persistent swelling was achieved only by addition of catabolizable substrate and both Na(+) and K(+). Addition, along with substrate, of Na(+) alone or K(+) alone did not stimulate swelling; no metabolic swelling occurred in the presence of a sugar to which the cells had not been induced. Confirmation of rapid uptake by induced cells of the inducer sugar, l-arabinose, but not the d-isomer, was obtained with (14)C-labeled substrate. Addition of NaN(3) completely inhibited swelling, and 2, 4-dinitrophenol and ouabain each suppressed it by 50%, indicating requirement for energy metabolism and involvement of an adenosine triphosphatase in the penetration phenomena of these cells.<Arabinose, metabolism, Azides, pharmacology, Dinitrophenols, pharmacology, Enzyme Induction, Marine Biology, Muramidase, pharmacology, Osmosis, Ouabain, pharmacology, Potassium, pharmacology, Pseudomonas, drug effects, metabolism, Sodium, pharmacology

16035046<Pathways of glucose metabolism by rough and smooth variants of Bacillus stearothermophilus.<The radiorespirometric method was used to study the pathways of glucose metabolism in the rough and smooth variants of Bacillus stearothermophilus NCA 1518. The Embden-Meyerhof (EM) pathway was more active in the smooth variant than in the rough variant. The participation of the hexose monophosphate shunt (HMP) and EM pathways in the smooth variant was calculated as 4.2 and 95.8%, respectively. The rough variant utilized glucose via the EM pathway exclusively or in combination with a pathway other than the HMP pathway. The estimated efficiency of the tricarboxylic acid system in the rough and smooth variants was 81.3 and 4.9%, respectively.<Bacillus, metabolism, Biochemistry, instrumentation, Carbon Dioxide, metabolism, Carbon Isotopes, Glucose, metabolism, Hexosephosphates, metabolism
16035047<Effects of a high magnetic field at different osmotic pressures and temperatures on multiplication of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.<The application of a yeast as a biosystem for determining the effects of a high magnetic field and other physical phenomena was studied. Multiplication of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was observed during exposure to a magnetic field of 4,600 gauss. Cell populations were determined at 24-, 48-, and 72-hr intervals, and possible interactions between the magnetic field and other environmental parameters, such as time, temperature, and osmotic pressure, were considered statistically. The main effect of the high magnetic field was a significant reduction of cell multiplication during each time interval. Significant interactions were found to occur between temperature and the magnetic field at 24 hr, and between temperature and osmotic pressure at each sampling interval. Synergistic effects of the magnetic field and osmotic pressure at both 28 and 38 C were nonsignificant.<Cell Division, Magnetics, Osmosis, Saccharomyces, growth &amp; development, Temperature
16035048<Quantitative bacteriological analysis of sputum as a test of antibiotic efficacy.<After 5 days of treatment, sputa were analyzed from 40 patients treated with sodium fusidate and 20 patients treated with naficillin.

16035049<Dechlorination of 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane by Aerobacter aerogenes. I. Metabolic products.<Whole cells or cell-free extracts of Aerobacter aerogenes catalyze the degradation of 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT) in vitro to at least seven metabolites: 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene (DDE); 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDD); 1-chloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene (DDMU); 1-chloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDMS); unsym-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene (DDNU); 2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)acetate (DDA); and 4,4'-dichlorobenzophenone (DBP). The use of metabolic inhibitors together with pH and temperature studies indicated that discrete enzymes are involved. By use of the technique of sequential analysis, the metabolic pathway was shown to be: DDT --&gt; DDD --&gt;DDMU --&gt;DDMS --&gt; DDNU --&gt; DDA --&gt; DBP, or DDT --&gt; DDE.

Potassium tartrate, potassium citrate and sucrose gradients were used to obtain viral concentrates from the density 1.16 to 1.18 zone. Proteolytic enzyme digestion of tissue culture preparations prior to zonal ultracentrifuge processing was effective in releasing virus from cell debris and producing highly purified, though nonleukemogenic, viral concentrates. Infected Rauscher mouse plasma was processed to give highly purified infectious virus fractions. A single centrifugation of crude Rauscher mouse spleen homogenates resulted in partially purified infectious concentrates with high virus particle counts.<Animals, Centrifugation, Zonal, Citrates, pharmacology, Culture Techniques, Mice, Microscopy, Electron, Moloney murine leukemia virus, isolation &amp; purification, Peptide Hydrolases, pharmacology, Rauscher Virus, isolation &amp; purification, pathogenicity, Spleen, microbiology, Splenomegaly, Sucrose, pharmacology, Tartrates, pharmacology, Viral Proteins, analysis, Virus Cultivation

16035052<Effect of virus input multiplicity and tissue cell concentration on growth of Rift Valley fever virus.<The effects of virus input multiplicity and of tissue cell concentration upon the growth of Rift Valley fever virus in L cells (Earle) were determined. The titers obtained in suspension cultures with cells obtained from two separate laboratories were significantly different. With both monolayer culture and suspension culture systems, a virus input multiplicity of 2.5 resulted in the greatest proliferation of virus. Optimal viral yields were obtained in suspension cultures containing 4 x 10(5) tissue cells per ml of suspension.<Arboviruses, growth &amp; development, Culture Techniques, L Cells, Virus Cultivation
16035053<Ergotamine production in submerged culture and physiology of Calviceps purpurea.<Strain 275 FI of Claviceps purpurea, which produces large amounts of peptide alkaloids in submerged culture, and strains V, C, and W, spontaneously obtained from 275 FI and practically unable to produce alkaloids, were compared. Strain 275 FI differs from the other strains in its capacity to accumulate lipids and sterols, as well as in its capacity to produce alkaloids. Strain 275 FI utilizes large quantities of sucrose and citric acid simultaneously; strain V utilizes large amounts of sucrose but little citric acid; strain C utilizes large quantities of citric acid but only small amounts of sucrose; strain W consumes only small amounts of both substances. We conclude that the production of large quantities of alkaloids, as well as the accumulation of lipids and sterols, is correlated with the simultaneous utilization of large amounts of sucrose and citric acid.<Ascomycota, metabolism, Citrates, metabolism, Culture Media, Ergotamine, biosynthesis, Lipid Metabolism, Mutation, Sterols, metabolism, Sucrose, metabolism
16035054<Heterokaryosis and alkaloid production in Claviceps purpurea.<Strain 275 FI of Claviceps purpurea, which produces large amounts of peptide alkaloids in submerged culture, is a heterokaryon; after several generations on agar media, it segregates the single components. These components (by us labeled V, C, and W) are stable and produce almost no alkaloids under described conditions of submerged culture. The mycelium of strain 275 FI consists of hyphae with multinucleate cells and does not produce conidia. Strains V, C, and W form numerous anastomoses when grown together on agar. By combining strains V and C, a heterokaryon similar to 275 FI in appearance has been obtained. This new strain produces amounts of alkaloids much larger than those produced by V and C separately or in associated submerged culture. We conclude, therefore, that in strain 275 FI the heterokaryotic condition is favorable to the production of alkaloids. Several conidiaproducing cultures of C. purpurea of various origins, as well as sclerotia of the same species, have been examined. The results demonstrated that the heterokaryotic condition is rare in the cultures, but it is frequent in the mycelium from sclerotia. Since it is known that the production of alkaloids is typical of the sclerotial phase in C. purpurea, it is suggested that this capacity is related to the heterokaryosis of the producing strains.<Alkaloids, biosynthesis, Ascomycota, growth &amp; development, metabolism, Cell Nucleus, Ergotamine, biosynthesis, Genetics
16035055<Microflora of black and red pepper.<Dilution cultures of 30 samples of ground black pepper yielded an average of 39,000 colonies of fungi per g, with a range of 1,700 to 310,000 per g. Total numbers of colonies of bacteria from 11 samples averaged 194,000,000 per g, with a range from 8,300,000 to 704,000,000 per g. A variety of fungi grew from nearly all surface-disinfected whole peppercorns that were cultured. Thirteen samples of ground red pepper from the United States yielded an average of 1,600 colonies of storage fungi per g and an equal number of other fungi; five samples from India yielded an average of 78,900 colonies of storage fungi per g and 169,400 colonies of other fungi per g. Among the fungi from both black and red pepper were Aspergillus flavus and A. ochraceus, some isolates of which, when grown for 8 to 10 days on moist autoclaved corn and fed to white rats or to 2-day-old Pekin ducklings, were rapidly lethal to them. Aflatoxin B(1) was isolated from one of the samples of corn on which A. flavus from black pepper was grown. Among the bacteria isolated from ground black pepper were Escherichia coli, E. freudii, Serratia sp., Klebsiella sp., Bacillus sp., Staphylococcus sp., and Streptococcus sp.

16035057<Morphological spore types in the Streptomyces hygroscopicus-like complex.<Streptomycetes comprising the Streptomyces hygroscopicus-like complex may be divided into two groups based on the micromorphology of their spores. The species S. hygroscopicus has short-cylindrical, phalangiform spores, whereas members of the second group possess elliptical-type spores. It was determined that S. platensis, of the latter group, is not only readily distinguishable from S. hygroscopicus on the basis of spore micromorphology, but differs, as well, according to various physiological measurements.<Spores, Streptomyces, classification, metabolism
16035122<Membrane potentials at zero current. The significance of a constant ionic permeability ratio.<The possibility has been examined that the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation for V(0), the total membrane potential at zero current, can be derived with constant permeability ratios from a thermodynamic treatment. The flux equations have been integrated under zero current conditions subject only to the restriction that the total membrane potential should be independent of internal concentration profiles, which is the requirement for the premeability ratios to be phenomenological constants, independent of solution conditions. No assumptions have been made concerning the electric potential profile. It was found that a constant permeability ratio can only be characteristic of systems satisfying certain relationships between ionic conductances and chemical potentials. From these relationships it was possible to define the permeability ratio in terms of the thermodynamic properties of the membrane quite generally and to identify the permeability ratio as the product of mobility ratio and ratio of partition coefficients. Moreover, the ionic conductance ratio at any point in the membrane has been shown to be expressable explicitly in terms of the permeability ratio and the activities of an external solution which would be in equilibrium with the point under consideration. Lastly, a number of conclusions have been reached regarding the range of applicability of the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation with constant permeability ratios.<Electrophysiology, Ions, Mathematics, Membrane Potentials, physiology, Permeability
16035123<A method to relate steady-state ionic currents, conductances, and membrane potential in ion exchange membranes with unknown thermodynamic properties.<A method is presented by which the steady-state properties of an homogeneous, permselective membrane at uniform temperature can be predicted without knowledge of its thermodynamic properties other than assuming that they are functions only of local mole fractions in the membrane. By making this assumption, it is shown how the ionic conductances can be calculated at any point in the membrane from two sets of measurements, (a) R(symm), the steady-state resistance of the membrane measured between identical solutions and (b) V(0), the potential difference between nonidentical solutions for zero current. These two parameters are measured at different external solution compositions (e.g. a varying sodium-potassium ratio ranging from zero to infinity). From these measurements it is shown how the flux equations may be integrated without a knowledge of mobilities, activity coefficients, and other interior membrane parameters. The application of the method to fixed site membranes with variable mobilities is described and the theory for this particular case has also been verified experimentally in glass membranes.1 A possible application to biological membranes is discussed and a comparison is made between the present treatment and previous treatments used to calculate the steady-state properties of cell membranes, notably the theory of Teorell, Meyer, and Sievers and the constant field theory.<Cell Membrane, physiology, Electrophysiology, Ion Exchange, Mathematics, Membrane Potentials, physiology, Thermodynamics
16035124<Ultraviolet sensitivity of the biological activity of phi-X-174 virus, single-stranded DNA, and RF DNA.<Action spectra for inactivation of varphiX virus, free varphiX single-stranded DNA, and double-stranded varphiX DNA (RF) have been measured using light of wavelength 225-302 mmu. The sensitivity of RF has been determined using bacterial hosts both capable and incapable of reactivation of UV damage. The inactivation of varphiX virus is due, at all wavelengths, to damage to its DNA; it appears that, below 240 mmu, energy absorbed by viral structural protein may inactivate the viral DNA. The variation of the probability of inactivation by an absorbed quantum (quantum yield) with wavelength, in the case of free-single-stranded varphiX DNA, suggests that energy absorbed by pyrimidine residues is more likely to yield inactivation than absorption by purines. This implies that energy transfer is not so extensive as to make all absorbed energy available to pyrimidines.<Coliphages, radiation effects, DNA, Viral, Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet Rays
16035125<Dynamic statistics of crayfish caudal photoreceptors.<Crayfish caudal photoreceptor units were monitored during transient and steady-state responses to light stimuli (step on, step off). A statistical analysis of interpulse interval distributions during quasi-stationary time periods was carried out. Firing statistics during transient conditions were superposable with statistics under whatever steady stimulation produced the same firing rate, indicating that mean firing rate is a sufficient statistic. Distributions encountered formed a continuum of possible shapes. Considerable variation in shape was found with temperature and also among species, with Orconectes clarkii tending to fire more regularly than Orconectes virilis. Some properties of O. virilis statistics are described, including a linear relation between mean and standard deviation, and a tendency for intervals to be nonindependent. The data are considered as constraints on closed form models of the photoreceptor nerve pulse generator.<Animals, Crustacea, physiology, Light, Models, Theoretical, Neural Conduction, physiology, Sensory Receptor Cells, physiology
16035126<Morphogenesis as influenced by locally administered magnetic fields.<An alteration in morphogenetic development induced in Drosophila melanogaster pupae by exposure to a magnetic probe was shown to persist for more than 30 generations. With succeeding inbred crossings, an initial increase in the time of development through the embryonic and postembryonic stages gradually approached the level found in control cultures. As the development time decreased, a concomitant increase occurred in the yield of progeny. The pattern of morphogenesis suggested a condition of homeostasis operating in an oscillating epigenetic system. The concept of a feedback control mechanism was employed to examine details of the alterations in development time. The data were compatible with this model and rates of recovery from an initial perturbation were determined in several series inbred for a large number of generations. Variations in rate constants and mechanisms involved in the magnetic field inhibition are discussed.<Animals, Drosophila, Enzymes, Genetics, Magnetics, Metamorphosis, Biological
16035258<Biosynthesis of alpha-isopropylmalic and citric acids in Acetobacter suboxydans.<Cell-free extracts of Acetobacter suboxydans were prepared which were capable of condensing alpha-ketoisovalerate with (14)C-labeled acetyl-coenzyme A to yield (14)C-labeled alpha-isopropylmalate. The product of the reaction was isolated by paper and column chromatography and was characterized by recrystallization with synthetic alpha-isopropylmalic acid to constant specific radioactivity. The formation of alpha-isopropylmalate by extracts of A. suboxydans plus the ability of the organism to grow in a simple glucose-glycerol medium containing glutamic acid as the only amino acid indicate that the pathway for leucine biosynthesis shown to exist in yeast and Salmonella typhimurium also occurs in A. suboxydans. As a comparison, the condensation of oxalacetate and ((14)C) acetyl-coenzyme A to yield ((14)C) citric acid was shown, by similar means, to occur in A. suboxydans. This is of interest since the existence of this classical condensing enzyme has hitherto not been demonstrated in this organism. This reaction was further demonstrated in cell-free extracts of A. suboxydans by means of a spectrophotometric assay at 232 mmu which measured the cleavage of the carbon-sulfur bond of acetyl-coenzyme A in the presence of oxalacetate. Comparison of the specific activities of crude cell-free extracts indicated a much more extensive occurrence of this reaction in yeast than in A. suboxydans.<Acetobacter, metabolism, Carbon Isotopes, Chromatography, Chromatography, Paper, Citrates, analysis, biosynthesis, Coenzyme A, metabolism, Crystallization, Keto Acids, metabolism, Malates, analysis, biosynthesis, Oxygen Consumption, Radiometry, Spectrophotometry, Valerates, metabolism
16035259<Growth of Bacillus coagulans in chemically defined media.<A nutritional study was made of five strains of Bacillus coagulans obtained from various culture collections. These five strains were descendants of two original isolates; three had been derived from one parent culture in years past and the other two were transfers from another parent culture. Therefore, the five cultures should have represented two distinct groups of genetically identical cultures. Three of the strains obtained from one culture collection had become methyl red-negative and sorbitol-negative and had gained abilities to hydrolyze gelatin and ferment arabinose. Nutritional requirements of the five cultures, determined at 37, 45, and 55 C, differed considerably among strains; however, thiamine and biotin were required by all cultures at all temperatures. Aspartic acid was stimulatory at 37 C and was required at 45 C; folic acid, basic amino acids, and certain other nutrilites were required at 55 C. Adenine supplementation was necessary for two strains at 55 C to prevent autolysis; this phenomenon is discussed. The response of these organisms to both serine and the basic amino acids at the three growth temperatures seems especially significant. The media devised for the growth of the five strains of B. coagulans used in this study permit excellent growth at three incubation temperatures.<Adenine, metabolism, Amino Acids, metabolism, Bacillus, isolation &amp; purification, metabolism, Biotin, metabolism, Culture Media, Temperature, Thiamine, metabolism, Vitamins, metabolism
16035260<Mutants of yeast sensitive to ultraviolet light.<Six uvr mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae with hypersensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) light were isolated after mutagen treatment with ethylmethanesulfonate. UV sensitivity ranges from moderate to extreme, and four of the mutants are also sensitive to nitrous acid. Ranking in terms of UV sensitivity does not parallel ranking in terms of nitrous acid sensitivity. Homozygous diploid mutant strains are somewhat less sensitive than the corresponding haploids. All mutations are recessive. None of the mutants is sensitive to gamma rays, and each shows photoreactivation after UV radiation. Complementation tests and tetrad analysis indicate that each strain represents mutation in a different gene. Two of the uvr genes are linked, and two others are centromere-linked.<Genetics, Light, Mutagens, pharmacology, Mutation, Nitrites, pharmacology, Saccharomyces, drug effects, radiation effects, Sulfonic Acids, pharmacology, Ultraviolet Rays
16035261<Tetanus toxin and antigenic derivatives. II. Effect of protein and formaldehyde concentration on toxoid formation.<Tetanus toxoid formation was examined under varying conditions. Products of the reaction depended upon the concentration of both formaldehyde and toxin. High concentrations of protein and formaldehyde favored the formation of large polymers, whereas low concentrations yielded smaller polymers and monomer.

16035262<Preliminary studies of some physiological properties of Torula jeanselmei.<The morphological characteristics of pathogenic and saprophytic strains of Torula jeanselmei (Fungi Imperfecti) are indistinguishable. Some basic physiological properties of T. jeanselmei were investigated in the hope of separating the human pathogenic strain from common saprophytes in a clinical laboratory. Nitrogen and carbon assimilation tests were not useful for distinguishing the pathogen, since all strains, pathogenic and saprophytic, were able to assimilate nitrogen from ammonium, nitrate, and nitrite sources, and all were able to utilize glucose, fructose, galactose, cellobiose, lactose, glycerol, and starch. It appeared that temperature range for growth might be useful in the identification of the pathogen. All pathogenic strains grew well at 37 C but poorly at 10 C; in contrast, all saprophytes could grow at 10 C but were unable to grow at 37 C (with two exceptions).<Carbohydrate Metabolism, Cryptococcus, isolation &amp; purification, metabolism, Culture Media, Humans, Nitrates, metabolism, Nitrites, metabolism, Quaternary Ammonium Compounds, metabolism, Temperature
16035263<Radiorespirometric studies of Leucothrix mucor.<Catabolic capabilities of Leucothrix mucor were studied by radiorespirometric technique with a liquid scintillation spectrometer. Through measurement of relative rates and total percentages of (14)CO(2) produced, together with the determination of the cellular incorporation of (14)C from different carbon atoms of various labeled substrates, such as simple carbohydrates, intermediary metabolites, and amino acids, the essential characteristics of the primary and secondary pathways operative in this organism were examined. These substrates appeared to be degraded mainly via enzymes of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway in conjunction with the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Estimation of concurrent participation of pathways indicated that 20 to 25% of the administered carbohydrate was catabolized via the pentose phosphate pathway. There was no evidence of the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway operating in this organism.<Acetates, metabolism, Amino Acids, metabolism, Bacteria, metabolism, Carbon Isotopes, Fructose, metabolism, Glucose, metabolism, Glutamates, metabolism, Glycine, metabolism, Manometry, Marine Biology, Pyruvates, metabolism, Radiometry, Succinates, metabolism
16035264<Inhibition of the lysis of fungi by melanins.<Evidence is presented that the resistance of Aspergillus nidulans hyphae to lysis by a beta-(1--&gt;3) glucanase-chitinase mixture results from the presence of melanin in the fungal walls. The resistance of the walls to digestion was directly correlated with the melanin content of the mycelium. A melanin-less mutant of A. nidulans was highly susceptible to hydrolysis by the enzyme mixture. Preincubation of a synthetic melanin with the glucanase, chitinase, and a protease, before addition of the substrate, resulted in a marked inhibition of the rate of substrate hydrolysis. Melanin also appeared to combine with and protect at least certain substrates from decomposition, as indicated by the direct relationship between the extent of inhibition of casein hydrolysis by a bacterial protease and the length of time the protein was incubated with the melanin prior to addition of the enzyme. Melanin was found to be highly resistant to microbial degradation, a likely requirement for the polyaromatic to be effective in protecting fungal structures from lysis or decomposition by natural communities of microorganisms.<Aspergillus, drug effects, metabolism, Caseins, metabolism, Cell Wall, drug effects, Chitinases, metabolism, Glycoside Hydrolases, metabolism, Melanins, pharmacology, Mutation, Peptide Hydrolases, metabolism
16035265<Linkage and segregation of unselected markers in matings of Nocardia erythropolis with Nocardia canicruria.<The segregation of unselected genes expressing resistance or susceptibility to acriflavine, erythromycin, streptomycin, and tetracycline was analyzed in selected prototrophic recombinants resulting from matings of Nocardia erythropolis and N. canicruria. The organisms were shown to be functionally haploid and appeared to contain not more than one genome. It was postulated that all observed genes were present in a linear linkage group. The ordering of the genes in N. erythropolis was: tetB10 eryB9 his-3 purA1 acr-2 strA1 (respectively, resistance to tetracycline and erythromycin, deficiency for histidine and for purine, and resistance to acriflavine and streptomycin). The ordering of the genes in N. canicruria was: purB2 tetA9 eryA7 acr-11 strB2 (respectively, deficiency for purine, and resistance to tetracycline, erythromycin, acriflavine, and streptomycin). Excluding the genes for acriflavine resistance, acr-2 and acr-11, resistance loci in N. erythropolis were not allelic to and showed lateral displacement from genes controlling phenotypically similar resistance in N. canicruria. Evidence for some lack of homology between N. erythropolis and N. canicruria genomes was found. Recombination phenomena between the nocardial species was postulated to occur as a result of formation of a heterogenomic zygote in which new combinations were produced. Production of selectable, haploid recombinants was ascribed to subsequent haploidization of the zygote.<Chromosome Mapping, Genetics, Molecular Biology, Mutation, Nocardia
16035266<Sphere-rod morphogenesis in Arthrobacter crystallopoietes. I. Cell wall composition and polysaccharides of the peptidoglycan.<Cell walls of Arthrobacter crystallopoietes were prepared from cells grown as spheres and from peptone- and succinate-induced rod stage cells. Undegraded polysaccharide backbones of the peptidoglycans were isolated from myxobacter AL-1 protease digests by ECTEOLA cellulose and Sephadex G-50 chromatography. The polysaccharide backbones of the sphere cell wall peptidoglycan are heterogeneous in their size, and average less than 40 hexosamines per chain. Those of the rod cell walls are homogeneous in size and average 114 to 135 hexosamines per chain.<Amino Acids, analysis, Amino Sugars, analysis, Arthrobacter, analysis, metabolism, Cell Wall, analysis, Chromatography, Chromatography, Gel, Culture Media, Peptides, analysis, Peptones, metabolism, Polysaccharides, Bacterial, analysis, Staphylococcus, analysis, Succinates, metabolism
16035267<Sphere-rod morphogenesis in Arthrobacter crystallopoietes. II. Peptides of the cell wall peptidoglycan.<Cell walls of Arthrobacter crystallopoietes grown as spheres and as rods were solubilized by treatment with the B enzyme from Chalaropsis, an N-acetylmuramidase. The neutral glycopeptides were then isolated by chromatography on ECTEOLA cellulose. The glycopeptides, consisting of disaccharide-peptide units interlinked by peptide cross-bridges, were fractionated by gel filtration on Sephadex columns into oligomers of various sizes. The size distribution ranged from monomers with no cross-bridges to polymers with a high degree of polymerization, but did not differ significantly between cell walls from cells grown as spheres or rods. Some small differences in the distribution of C- and N-terminal amino acids were found. Analyses revealed that all the peptide bridges in the glycopeptide fractions from rod cell walls were formed by one l-alanine residue. In sphere cell walls, l-alanine was also found, but, in addition, higher oligomers of the glycopeptide contained glycine in their cross-bridges. These results were confirmed by determinations of C- and N-terminal amino acids released after lysostaphin and AL-1 enzyme digestions and by Edman degradations. Models representing the structures of the sphere and rod cell walls are presented. These structures indicate that the sphere cell wall is probably a more loosely knit macromolecule than is the rod cell wall.<Alanine, analysis, Arthrobacter, analysis, metabolism, Cell Wall, analysis, drug effects, Chromatography, Chromatography, Gel, Glutamates, analysis, Glycine, analysis, Lysine, analysis, Muramidase, pharmacology, Peptides, analysis, Peptones, metabolism, Succinates, metabolism
16035268<Electron microscopy of the combination of antibodies with flagellar antigen and with a pyocine.<Micrographs are presented of antibodies in combination with flagella of Salmonella typhi and with a phage-bound pyocine Rmc, which is supposed to be the tail of a defective bacteriophage from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The pyocine preparation seems to offer advantages for the study of antibody-antigen complexes. Under the conditions of our experiments, the surfaces of the antigenic structures are saturated with antibody layers approximately 95 A in thickness, i.e., slightly less than half the accepted lengths of 7S antibody molecules. Our interpretation is that the antibody is attached by combining sites at the ends of the molecules to form loops along the surface of the antigenic structures.<Animals, Anti-Bacterial Agents, Antigen-Antibody Reactions, Bacteriophages, immunology, Complement System Proteins, pharmacology, Flagella, Formaldehyde, pharmacology, Immune Sera, pharmacology, Microscopy, Electron, Rabbits, Salmonella typhi, immunology
16035269<Comparisons of cells, refractile bodies, and spores of Bacillus popilliae.<Spores of Bacillus popilliae from infected larvae and refractile bodies produced in a Trypticase-barbiturate medium were similar but distinct from vegetative cells of this organism in protein, nucleic acid, and enzyme composition. The spores and refractile bodies were found to have catalase activity, some of which was heat-resistant. This enzyme was not found in the vegetative cells. The spores contained dipicolinic acid, but the refractile bodies did not. The latter were similar to cells in having considerably higher levels of phosphate extractable with cold trichloroacetic acid and of poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate than had the spores. Electron microscopy demonstrated conclusively that the refractile bodies are distinctly different from either cells or spores of B. popilliae. The possibility that these bodies are formed as a result of an aborted sporulation process is discussed.<Bacillus, analysis, enzymology, Bacterial Proteins, analysis, Culture Media, DNA, Bacterial, analysis, Hydroxybutyrates, analysis, Microscopy, Electron, Phosphates, analysis, Pyridines, analysis, RNA, Bacterial, analysis, Spores
16035270<Micromorphology of Cryptococcus neoformans.<Fine details of the internal and external morphology of Cryptococcus neoformans as seen in ultrathin sections are described and illustrated with electron micrographs. The capsule characteristic of this species contained microfibrils (30 to 40 A in diameter) that appeared to radiate from the cell wall and to coil and intertwine in various directions. These thin, uniformly structured, electron-dense filaments are believed to represent complex polysaccharide molecules. The internal morphology of C. neoformans was in many ways similar to that of yeasts studied by other authors. The cell was uninucleate with a single nucleolus. The nuclear envelope, a pair of unit membranes interrupted by pores, was typical of that found in eucaryotic organisms. Smooth endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, vacuoles, storage granules, and ribosomes were consistent features of the cytoplasm. In addition, C. neoformans presented membranous organelles derived from the plasma membrane and comparable to bacterial mesosomes and mitochondria of an annulate type.<Cell Wall, Cryptococcus, cytology, Microscopy, Electron, Mitochondria
16035504<Fractionation of neurophysin by molecular-sieve and ion-exchange chromatography.<Neurophysin has been separated into seven distinct protein fractions. One of these components had no hormone-binding activity. The fractions that had hormone-binding activity were similar in amino acid composition: their cystine content was in the range 11.5-14.5%. The major component, neurophysin-M, was distinguished from the protein isolated by van Dyke by the presence of methionine and the absence of histidine. Neurophysin-M binds both oxytocin and vasopressin with similar affinities.<Amino Acids, analysis, Animals, Cattle, Chromatography, Chromatography, Gel, Dialysis, Electrophoresis, Histidine, In Vitro Techniques, Methionine, Pituitary Hormones, Posterior, analysis, Ultracentrifugation
16035505<Structural studies on lens proteins.<The sequence around the thiol group in lens proteins has been investigated. The proteins were converted into their carboxy[(14)C]methyl derivatives and submitted to partial acid hydrolysis, or digested with proteolytic enzymes. Acid hydrolysis of bovine alpha-crystallin gives N-seryl-(S-carboxymethyl)cysteine, Ser-CMCys (Waley, 1965a), but this dipeptide is not obtained from beta-crystallin or gamma-crystallin. Trypsin and chymotrypsin also give different peptides from the three crystallins. The radioactive peptide from alpha-crystallin and chymotrypsin has the sequence Ser-CMCys-Ser-Leu; another peptide, Asp-Leu-Leu-Phe, was also identified. The radioactive peptides obtained from bovine alpha-crystallin are probably also obtained from human alpha-crystallin, and from bovine and human albuminoid (the insoluble lens protein). alpha-Crystallin has been fractionated by chromatography in urea on DEAE-cellulose. Comparison of the fractions by peptide ;mapping', and immunochemically, shows that they fall into two classes. The fraction eluted first differs from the later fractions, but the later fractions resemble each other The first fraction may represent impurities, or it may be a structurally different sub-unit of alpha-crystallin.<Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, Autoradiography, Cattle, Chromatography, Chymotrypsin, Crystallins, analysis, Electrophoresis, Eye Proteins, analysis, In Vitro Techniques, Lens, Crystalline, Peptides, analysis, Trypsin
16035506<Rates of entry and oxidation of acetate, glucose, D(-)-beta-hydroxybutyrate, palmitate, oleate and stearate, and rates of production and oxidation of propionate and butyrate in fed and starved sheep.<1. Rates of entry and oxidation of a range of metabolites have been measured in tracheostomized sheep (diet, 800g. of lucerne chaff and 100g. of maize/day) by combining isotope-dilution techniques with the continuous measurement of total respiratory gas exchange, and (14)CO(2) production during the intravenous or intraruminal infusion of (14)C-labelled substrates. 2. Mean entry rates in fed and starved (24hr.) sheep respectively, expressed as mg./min./kg. body wt.(0.75), were: glucose, 5.0 (range 4.8-5.1, 2 observations) and 3.8 (3.2-4.2, 4); acetate, 10.8 (9.1-13.5, 4) and 5.8 (1); d(-)-beta-hydroxybutyrate, 1.4 (1) and 1.5 (0.8-2.4, 4); palmitate, oleate and stearate (starved sheep only) 1.0 (0.6-1.9, 7), 0.9 (0.2-1.6, 10) and 0.9 (0.5-1.1, 11) respectively. 3. Production rates of propionate and butyrate in continuously feeding sheep were 6.4 (4.7-8.3, 4) and 4.3 (3.4-6.1, 4) mg./min./kg.(0.75) respectively, and in starved (24hr.) sheep were 2.5 (2.2-2.9, 2) and 1.0 (0.8-1.2, 2) mg./min./kg.(0.75) respectively. 4. Calculated terminal values for the specific radioactivity of respiratory (14)CO(2) during measurements of entry rates and production rates were used to calculate the contributions of individual substrates to overall oxidative metabolism. Mean values for fed and starved sheep respectively were: glucose, 9.1 (8.6-9.6, 2) and 11.2 (5.9-15.1, 4)%; acetate, 31.6 (26.8-38.1, 4) and 22.1 (1)%; d(-)-beta-hydroxybutyrate, 10.4 (1) and 4.8 (1.9-7.7, 4)%; propionate, 23.0 (13.8-29.9, 4) and 7.1 (6.8-7.4, 2)%; butyrate, 16.5 (13.7-20.5, 4) and 5.3 (5.2-5.3, 2)%; palmitate, oleate and stearate (starved sheep only), 4.7 (2.0-7.7, 7), 4.0 (1.2-6.6, 10) and 4.4 (3.8-5.8, 9)% respectively. The sum of these values for individual substrates in fed and starved sheep, excluding that of beta-hydroxybutyrate and after correction of the glucose value for the known interrelations of this substrate with propionate, accounted for 76% and 58% respectively of total production of carbon dioxide. 5. Calculations based on the proportion of substrate entry directly oxidized indicated that the substrates studied accounted for 63% (fed sheep) and 43% (starved sheep) of total energy expenditure measured by oxygen uptake. The contribution of beta-hydroxybutyrate was excluded, and corrections were made for glucose-propionate interrelations, and for the different rates of oxidation of the methyl and carboxyl fragments of acetate. 6. The present results have been combined with those obtained earlier in this Laboratory to examine the relationships between rates of substrate entry and oxidation, and concentrations of substrate in blood. Rates of entry of acetate, glucose, d(-)-beta-hydroxybutyrate, palmitate and oleate (but not stearate) were well correlated with concentration in blood, and substrate contribution to production of carbon dioxide showed a similar correlation to blood concentration, except with glucose. 7. It was concluded that the general technique is of potential value in providing valid quantitative parameters of animal metabolism.<Acetates, blood, metabolism, Animals, Bicarbonates, metabolism, Butyrates, metabolism, Carbon Dioxide, Carbon Isotopes, Fatty Acids, Nonesterified, blood, Glucose, metabolism, Hydroxybutyrates, metabolism, Oleic Acids, metabolism, Palmitic Acids, metabolism, Propionates, metabolism, Rumen, metabolism, Sheep, metabolism, Starvation, metabolism, Stearic Acids, metabolism
16035507<The osmotically sensitive potassium and sodium compartments of synaptosomes.<1. Synaptosomes are pinched-off nerve terminals whose components can be liberated by osmotic ;shock'. A synaptosome preparation run through a Sephadex column that was eluted with an iso-osmotic solution retained its small ions, whereas when the column was eluted hypo-osmotically the small ions were lost. In this way the osmotically sensitive Na(+) and K(+) of synaptosomes were measured. Measurements of the lactate dehydrogenase occluded within the synaptosome were also made. The release of osmotically sensitive Na(+) and K(+) and occluded lactate dehydrogenase had similar characteristics with respect to the degree of osmotic ;shock' necessary and the action of lytic agents. 2. The distribution of osmotically sensitive Na(+), K(+) and occluded lactate dehydrogenase in the subfractions of a crude mitochondrial preparation was examined. The synaptosome fraction was the richest source of these constituents. 3. On standing at 5 degrees in iso-osmotic solution Na(+) and K(+) were lost from synaptosomes, whereas the amount of occluded lactate dehydrogenase remained stable, suggesting that the synaptosome membrane retained its integrity but that Na(+) and K(+) diffused through it out of the osmotically sensitive compartment. 4. The uptake of Na(+) and K(+) into the osmotically sensitive compartment was examined. At 5 degrees the rates of uptake of Na(+) and K(+) were found to be equal to the rates of loss of these ions when correction to a uniform concentration gradient had been made. K(+) travelled across the membrane slightly faster than Na(+), the rate of K(+) movement being about 1.0mumuequiv.cm.(-2)sec.(-1) under a concentration gradient of 0.1m. Active transport is not thought to contribute to the ion movements under the conditions used. 5. The amount of K(+) taken up into the osmotically sensitive compartment as a function of the external concentration was examined. Since the uncharged molecule d-[(14)C]galactose distributes across the synaptosome membrane similarly to K(+) there is not thought to be a synaptosomal trans-membrane potential. The volume of the osmotically sensitive compartment was measured by this method and found to agree with estimates of the synaptosomal volume made from morphological studies. In media of low ionic strength synaptosomes exhibit a Donnan effect. 6. It is concluded from these studies that the osmotically sensitive compartment represents the inner volume of the synaptosome, which is completely separated from the outside environment by a diffusion barrier having many of the general properties of a biological membrane.<Animals, Biological Transport, Cerebral Cortex, cytology, Chromatography, Gel, Galactose, metabolism, Guinea Pigs, In Vitro Techniques, L-Lactate Dehydrogenase, metabolism, Nerve Endings, cytology, Organoids, analysis, metabolism, Osmosis, Potassium, analysis, metabolism, Rodentia, Sodium, analysis, metabolism
16035508<The time-course of the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate in Ehrlich ascites-tumour cells, and the effect of 2,4-dinitrophenol.<1. In Ehrlich ascites-tumour cells kept in nitrogen at 20 degrees for 20-30min., the ATP concentration falls from about 15mumoles/g. dry wt. to 2-3mumoles/g. dry wt. 2. If oxygen is admitted to such cells, the ATP concentration rises again in 1-2min. to about 15mumoles/g. dry wt. 3. If glucose is added, in nitrogen, there is a slower increase in ATP concentration to about 6mumoles/g. dry wt., followed by a fall and then by a still slower rise. 4. With glucose and oxygen, the ATP concentration rises rapidly in 1min. to about 8mumoles/g. dry wt., then falls, and finally increases slowly to reach 15mumoles/g. dry wt. in 2hr. 5. 2,4-Dinitrophenol (0.3mm) has little effect on these processes. 6. At 1.0mm, 2,4-dinitrophenol completely inhibits the ATP synthesis dependent on the endogenous respiration, while leaving that in the presence of glucose only a little impaired in rate, and considerably greater in magnitude. 7. ATP synthesis in the presence of glucose and 1.0mm-2,4-dinitrophenol is about three times as fast in oxygen as in nitrogen.<Adenosine Triphosphate, biosynthesis, Animals, Carcinoma, Ehrlich Tumor, metabolism, Dinitrophenols, pharmacology, Glucose, pharmacology, In Vitro Techniques, Iodoacetates, pharmacology, Mice, Nitrogen, pharmacology, Oxygen, pharmacology
16035509<Polygalacturonic acid trans-eliminase of Xanthomonas campestris.<Polygalacturonic acid trans-eliminase from the culture fluid of Xanthomonas campestris was purified 66-fold by acetone precipitation, citrate extraction and chromatography on diethylaminoethyl- and carboxymethyl-cellulose. The optimum pH is 9.5 in glycine-sodium hydroxide buffer. Up to 1mm-calcium chloride brings about a remarkable stimulation of the enzyme activity and, at this concentration, no other cations promote or inhibit enzyme action except Ba(2+) ions, which cause complete inhibition. The enzyme degrades polygalacturonic acid in a random manner; it does not act upon polygalacturonate methyl glycoside, although it can cleave partially (68%) esterified pectin. The end products from polygalacturonic acid at 46% breakdown are unsaturated di- and tri-galacturonic acids, in addition to saturated mono-, di- and tri-galacturonic acids. Pentagalacturonic acid is split preferentially into saturated dimer plus unsaturated trimer, or into saturated trimer plus unsaturated dimer; at a lower rate, it is also split into monomer and unsaturated tetramer. Unsaturated pentamer is split into unsaturated dimer plus unsaturated trimer. Tetragalacturonic acid is split some-what preferentially at the central bond to form dimer and unsaturated dimer, but it is also split into monomer and unsaturated trimer. Unsaturated tetramer is split only at the central bond to yield only unsaturated dimer. Trigalacturonic acid is split into monomer and unsaturated dimer. Unsaturated trimer is cleaved into saturated dimer and probably 4-deoxy-l-5-threo-hexoseulose uronic acid, which has not yet been directly identified. Neither saturated nor unsaturated digalacturonic acid is attacked. The unsaturated digalacturonic acid was isolated and proved to be O-(4-deoxy-beta-l-5-threo-hexopyranos-4-enyluronic acid)-(1--&gt;4)-d-galacturonic acid.<Calcium Chloride, pharmacology, Chromatography, Paper, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Lyases, metabolism, Pectins, metabolism, Polysaccharides, metabolism, Uronic Acids, metabolism, Xanthomonas, enzymology
16035510<The effect of thioacetamide on the maturation of high-molecular-weight ribonucleic acid in tumour cells.<1. Although thioacetamide treatment of Krebs II ascites-tumour cells did not markedly affect the rate of RNA synthesis in vivo, it caused the formation of an unusual single-stranded RNA component sedimenting at approx. 26s. 2. The maturation process leading to the formation of methylated RNA was examined by following the kinetics of incorporation into RNA of radioactivity from [G-(3)H]uridine and l-[Me-(14)C]methionine. In treated and untreated tumour cells extensive methylation was observed, not only of the ribosomal RNA species, but also of their precursors, especially the precursor species sedimenting at 35s. 3. Evidence is also presented to suggest that methylation of low-molecular-weight RNA species occurs both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm of these tumour cells. 4. Thioacetamide did not appear to have an effect on RNA methylation in vivo, and in thioacetamide-treated cells the 26s RNA accumulated within the nucleus, where it was methylated. 5. It is postulated that the 26s RNA is most likely to arise as a result of a fault in the scission process that gives rise to the ribosomal RNA components from their high-molecular-weight precursors.<Amides, pharmacology, Animals, Carbon Isotopes, Carcinoma, Krebs 2, metabolism, In Vitro Techniques, Methionine, metabolism, Mice, Phosphorus Isotopes, RNA, Neoplasm, analysis, biosynthesis, Sulfhydryl Compounds, pharmacology, Tritium, Ultracentrifugation, Uridine, metabolism

The enzyme from guinea-pig liver that degrades pyridine-haemochromogen into formylbiliverdin, a possible precursor of biliverdin, breaks the porphyrin ring exclusively at the alpha-methene bridge. The enzyme is therefore appropriately named haem alpha-methenyl oxygenase. 2.

16035513<Studies on brain-cortex slices. The influence of various inhibitors on the retention of potassium ions and amino acids with glucose or pyruvate as substrate.<1. The K(+) content of brain-cortex slices incubated in a Krebs-Ringer phosphate medium was the same whether the substrate was glucose (11mm) or pyruvate (11mm). 2. 2,4-Dinitrophenol (30mum) and ouabain (83mum) lowered the K(+) content of brain-cortex slices by approx. 40% with either glucose or pyruvate as the substrate. Triethyltin (1.3mum) lowered the K(+) content by 73% with glucose as substrate, but by only 18% when the substrate was pyruvate. 3. Quantitative estimations of six individual amino acids were made on brain-cortex slices and on the incubation medium after 75min. at 37 degrees . Some differences were found depending on whether the substrate was glucose or pyruvate. The effects of 2,4-dinitrophenol, oligomycin, triethyltin and ouabain were studied. Triethyltin caused a marked increase in the medium of each amino acid when the substrate was glucose, but not when it was pyruvate. Ouabain caused a similar increase with either glucose or pyruvate as substrate. 4. The uptake of triethyltin by brain-cortex slices was measured by using radioactive triethyl[(113)Sn]tin chloride. Various experimental conditions did not alter the uptake; these included adding glucose or pyruvate as a substrate. 5. From the author's own results and those of others it is suggested that pyruvate is an unsuitable substrate to use for the study of regulatory factors of endogenous pyruvate metabolism in brain-cortex slices.

16035514<Microsomal components in relation to amino acid incorporation by preparations from the developing rat brain.<1. After incorporation of [(14)C]valine in vitro, cerebral microsomes were separated into membrane-bound and free ribosomes by sucrose-density-gradient centrifugation. 2. In preparations from both 4-day-old and adult rats, free and bound ribosomes incorporated [(14)C]valine. Free ribosomes could be found as polysomes, which were highly active. 3. Microsomes labelled with [(14)C]valine in vitro were fractionated after deoxycholate treatment into a preliminary sediment, sedimented at 105000g (5min.), and ribonucleoprotein particles, sedimented at 150000g (70min.), to determine the role of membrane-bound ribosomes. In the adult the ribonucleoprotein particles retained most of the radioactivity, whereas in the young the preliminary sediment was as highly labelled as the ribonucleoprotein particles. 4. The labelled preliminary sediment from young preparations was both ribonuclease- and deoxycholate-resistant, and the nature of this material is discussed in terms of a possible structural component of microsomal membranes.<Animals, Animals, Newborn, Brain, cytology, growth &amp; development, metabolism, Carbon Isotopes, In Vitro Techniques, Microsomes, metabolism, Nerve Tissue Proteins, biosynthesis, Nucleoproteins, biosynthesis, Rats, Ribonucleases, Surface-Active Agents, Ultracentrifugation, Valine, metabolism

The enzyme has been purified 310-fold. 2. The purified preparation behaves as a single protein under gel filtration on Sephadex and Bio-Gel columns; it migrates as a single band in disk and starch-gel electro-phoresis at different pH values and it sediments as a single symmetrical peak in the ultracentrifuge. 3. The pH optimum for the pure enzyme was 6.8, the K(m) at pH 6.8 and 38 degrees was 1.5x10(-4)m, the isoelectric point was about pH 4.9 and the molecular weight was 140000+/-14000 by the gel-filtration method. Maximal enzyme activity was observed at 65 degrees . 4. The presence of thiol groups in the enzyme system, essential for its activity, was indicated and the total number of thiol groups was determined. 5. After the first steps of purification the enzyme required cysteine or reduced glutathione for activity.<Animals, Cattle, Chromatography, Gel, Electrophoresis, Hydro-Lyases, analysis, metabolism, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, In Vitro Techniques, Levulinic Acids, Liver, enzymology, Molecular Weight, Porphyrins, biosynthesis
16035516<Steroid metabolism in the rabbit. Biliary and urinary excretion of metabolites of [4-14-C]testosterone.<1. [4-(14)C]Testosterone was administered to anaesthetized male and female New Zealand White rabbits as a single injection or as a 45-60min. infusion. 2. After a single dose a total of approx. 56-80% of the radioactivity was excreted in bile and urine. After infusion total recovery of radioactivity was approx. 63-75%. 3. The mean ratio of metabolites in urine to those in bile was 0.77+/-0.41 (range 0.3-1.5). 4. Bile and urine samples were hydrolysed successively by beta-glucuronidase, cold acid and hot acid. In both bile and urine neutral metabolites extracted by ethyl acetate-ether were found mainly after beta-glucuronidase hydrolysis, but a considerable proportion of the dose was converted into substances not extractable from alkaline aqueous solution after all forms of hydrolysis used.<Animals, Bile, Carbon Isotopes, Cats, Female, Glucuronidase, Male, Progesterone, urine, Rabbits, Testosterone, metabolism, urine
16035517<The exchange of unesterified cholesterol between human low-density lipoproteins and rat erythrocyte 'ghosts'.<1. The exchange of unesterified cholesterol molecules between rat erythrocyte ;ghosts' and human low-density lipoproteins has been studied under a number of different experimental conditions. 2. The process is pH-dependent, the rate being minimal at about pH5. 3. Cholesterol exchange does not vary greatly with temperature, the rate at 50 degrees being less than twice that at 2 degrees . 4. Large variations in the ionic strength or Ca(2+) concentration of the medium have little effect, but the exchange rate is greatly increased in the presence of a wide range of chemical compounds, e.g. urea, alcohols, acetone, dimethyl sulphoxide and tetra-alkyl-ammonium salts. 5. Acetone and dimethyl sulphoxide have a much greater effect at 37 degrees than at 8-10 degrees . 6. It is proposed that hydrophobic bonding is of great importance in maintaining the structure of ;ghosts' and lipoproteins. 7.

16035518<Phage-induced fucosidases hydrolysing the exopolysaccharide of Klebsiella arogenes type 54 [A3(S1)].<Several strains of bacteriophage have been isolated that induce the formation of a polysaccharide hydrolase after infection of Klebsiella aerogenes type 54 [A3(S1)]. The action of this enzyme on polysaccharide solutions was to decrease their viscosity and increase their reducing value. These effects were associated with the release of two oligosaccharides (O1 and O2) from the polysaccharide. These two substances are not identical with any of the four oligosaccharides isolated from autohydrolysates. The two enzymically isolated fractions have been tentatively identified as tetrasaccharides, and oligosaccharide O2 is probably an acetylated version of oligosaccharide O1. This latter oligosaccharide differs in some way, still unknown, from the tetrasaccharide cellobiosylglucuronosylfucose found in acid hydrolysates of the slime polysaccharide. The enzyme is limited in its activity to the polysaccharide excreted by the A3 strain of K. aerogenes type 54 or by similar strains. It is also active on the polysaccharides altered by acid or alkaline treatment. The enzyme has optimum activity at pH6.5. A study of the products released by enzyme action has shown it to be a fucosidase splitting the fucosylglucose linkages found in the intact polysaccharide.<Bacteriophages, Chromatography, Paper, Electrophoresis, Enzyme Induction, Glycoside Hydrolases, biosynthesis, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Klebsiella, enzymology, Oligosaccharides, analysis, Polysaccharides, Bacterial, metabolism
16035519<The subcellular distribution and properties of hexokinases in the guinea-pig cerebral cortex.<1. Hexokinase activities were estimated in primary subcellular fractions from guinea-pig cerebral cortex and in sucrose-density-gradient subfractions of the mitochondrial and microsomal fractions. 2. Appreciable activities were observed in mitochondrial, microsomal and soluble fractions. The activity in the mitochondrial fraction was associated with the mitochondria rather than with myelin or nerve endings and that in the microsomal fraction was associated with membrane fragments. 3. Most of the mitochondrial activity was extracted in soluble form by osmotic ;shock'. The activity of the mitochondrial extract differed from the soluble activity in kinetic properties and in electrophoretic behaviour. 4. No evidence was obtained for the presence of a high-K(m) glucokinase in the brain. 5. The results are discussed in terms of relevance to considerations of glucose utilization by the brain.<Adenosine Triphosphate, metabolism, Animals, Centrifugation, Density Gradient, Cerebral Cortex, cytology, enzymology, Electrophoresis, Glucose, metabolism, Guinea Pigs, Hexokinase, metabolism, In Vitro Techniques, Kinetics, Microsomes, enzymology, Mitochondria, enzymology
16035521<Metabolism of triglyceride fatty acid by the perfused rat heart.<1. Chyle lipids, labelled with (14)C, are taken up and oxidized by the isolated perfused rat heart. 2. In recirculatory perfusions, when chyle lipids are the sole exogenous energy source, about 24% of the total oxygen uptake is accounted for by their oxidation. This proportion is not changed by starvation of the rats for 48hr. and falls when an external work load is imposed on the left ventricle. 3. With albumin in the perfusion medium, the rate of (14)CO(2) output is reduced by half and there is a rise in the proportion of (14)C-labelled free fatty acids in the medium. 4. Clearing-factor lipase appears in the perfusion medium when chyle lipids are perfused through the heart. In the absence of albumin, the activity of the medium enzyme is low and only a small proportion of the (14)CO(2) output can be accounted for by the oxidation of free fatty acids released by it. In the presence of albumin, the enzyme is more active in the medium. 5. When a substantial proportion of the total clearing-factor lipase is removed from the heart by a prior perfusion with heparin, (14)C-labelled chyle lipid perfused subsequently is oxidized at only half the normal rate.<Animals, Carbon Dioxide, Carbon Isotopes, Chyle, Fatty Acids, metabolism, Fatty Acids, Nonesterified, metabolism, Female, Glycerides, metabolism, Heparin, pharmacology, In Vitro Techniques, Lipoprotein Lipase, metabolism, Myocardium, metabolism, Perfusion, Rats, Triglycerides, metabolism

16035525<The effect of osmotic 'shock' on the swelling pattern and respiratory control of rat-liver mitochondria.<1. Rat-liver mitochondria suspended in 0.25m-sucrose were exposed for a few seconds to strongly hypo-osmotic conditions, and then the osmolarity of the medium was raised again to 0.25 with the aid of tris chloride (osmotic ;shock'). 2. Mitochondria after hypo-osmotic pretreatment lost their capacity for slow energy-dependent swelling in iso-osmotic tris buffer and showed no respiratory control. 3. Swelling could be induced in the ;shocked' mitochondria by ATP but not by addition of respiratory substrates. 4. It was shown that cytochrome c is lost from ;shocked' mitochondria when they come into contact with the tris buffer present in the assay medium, and that the changes observed in the pattern of swelling, as well as in respiratory control, are directly connected with this loss of cytochrome c. 5. The results of the investigation are discussed with regard to the role of cytochrome c in swelling and respiratory control.<Adenosine Triphosphate, pharmacology, Amobarbital, pharmacology, Animals, Cytochromes, pharmacology, Dinitrophenols, pharmacology, Glutathione, pharmacology, In Vitro Techniques, Liver, cytology, metabolism, Male, Mitochondria, metabolism, Osmosis, Rats, Rotenone, pharmacology, Succinates, metabolism

16035527<Oestrogen conjugates of human late-pregnancy urine.<1. The separation of the oestrogen conjugates in late-pregnancy urine into two groups, peaks I and II, by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 (Beling, 1963) has been shown to be affected by the presence of urate, which delays the elution of peak II conjugates. 2. By reapplication to a Sephadex column, peak I conjugates have been further separated into two groups (peaks IA and IB) and the metabolites in urine effecting this separation have been studied. 3. Further analysis of the mixed conjugates in the main groups IA, IB and II by ion-exchange and partition chromatography has led to the identification of some of the conjugates present. 4. Oestriol 3-sulphate 16alpha-glucuronide and 16alpha-hydroxyoestrone 3-sulphate 16alpha-glucuronide have been identified in peak IA. 5. The main components of peak IB have been identified as oestrone 3-glucuronide and oestriol 3-glucuronide. 6. The major conjugate in peak II was oestriol 16alpha-glucuronide and no oestriol 17beta-glucuronide was found; small amounts of the ring-d monoglucuronides oestradiol 17beta-glucuronide, 16-epioestriol 16beta-glucuronide and 16alpha-hydroxyoestrone 16alpha-glucuronide were found in this fraction. 7.

Evidence is presented that the enzyme involved is different from the known glutathione-conjugating enzymes, glutathione S-alkyltransferase, S-aryltransferase and S-epoxidetransferase. 3.

16035639<A comparative study of the ultrastructure of microvilli in the epithelium of small and large intestine of mice.<A comparative analysis of the fine structure of the microvilli on jejunal and colonic epithelial cells of the mouse intestine has been made. The microvilli in these two locations demonstrate a remarkably similar fine structure with respect to the thickness of the plasma membrane, the extent of the filament-free zone, and the characteristics of the microfilaments situated within the microvillous core. Some of the core microfilaments appear to continue across the plasma membrane limiting the tip of the microvillus. The main difference between the microvilli of small intestine and colon is in the extent and organization of the surface coat. In the small intestine, in addition to the commonly observed thin surface "fuzz," occasional areas of the jejunal villus show a more conspicuous surface coat covering the tips of the microvilli. Evidence has been put forward which indicates that the surface coat is an integral part of the epithelial cells. In contrast to the jejunal epithelium, the colonic epithelium is endowed with a thicker surface coat. Variations in the organization of the surface coat at different levels of the colonic crypts have also been noted. The functional significance of these variations in the surface coat is discussed.<Animals, Cell Membrane, Colon, cytology, physiology, Epithelial Cells, Jejunum, cytology, physiology, Mice, Microscopy, Electron
16035640<Action of colcemid in sea urchin eggs.<The effects of Colcemid, the deacetyl-N-methyl derivative of colchicine, on the eggs of Arbacia punctulata were investigated. Colcemid in concentrations of 2.7 x 10(-5)M or greater blocks syngamy (the fusion of the pronuclei) in these eggs. Although a tenfold decrease in concentration of Colcemid usually permits the pronuclei to fuse, the subsequent division is blocked. In the sea urchin egg, the duration of presyngamy is about 15 min during which time there is no DNA synthesis. However, DNA synthesis is recorded in Colcemid-blocked cells prior to syngamy. Radioautographs of Colcemid-blocked cells which were immersed into thymidine-(3)H exhibited silver grains above each of the pronuclei. The action of Colcemid on Arbacia eggs is reversible. Nevertheless, exposures to 2.7 x 10(-5)M Colcemid for only 3 min, initiated 5 min after insemination, caused delays of 70 min in subsequent division. In general, cells are more sensitive to Colcemid prior to the time when the mitotic spindle is being assembled than at presyngamy stages. The results are discussed in terms of Colcemid action on pronuclear fusion and cell division.<Animals, Autoradiography, Cell Division, drug effects, Cell Nucleus, metabolism, Colchicine, pharmacology, DNA, biosynthesis, Echinodermata, drug effects, Female, Male, Ovum, drug effects, Thymidine, metabolism, Tritium
16035641<Occurrence, isolation, and characterization of polyribosomes in yeast.<This report details the procedural requirements for preparing cell-free extracts of yeast rich in polyribosomes. This enabled us to demonstrate the occurrence of polyribosomes in yeast, to show their role in protein synthesis, and to devise methods for their resolution and isolation. When certain precautions are met (the use of log phase cells, rapidly halting cell growth, gentle methods of disruption, sedimentation through exponential density gradients, etc.), individual polyribosome size classes ranging up to the heptosome can be fractionated and separated from their nearest neighbors. Larger size classes are resolved partially among themselves, free of smaller polyribosomes. This was confirmed by extensive electron micrographic studies of material from the various fractions obtained upon density gradient centrifugation of yeast extracts. Modifications of the gradients and procedure should allow fractionation and isolation of the larger polyribosomes, including those containing polycistronic messages. Yeast polyribosomes are disaggregated to single ribosomes by longer term grinding, cell disruption by the French pressure cell, the Hughes press, or by incubation with dilute RNAse. Yeast polyribosomes are active in the incorporation of amino acids into polypeptide; the single ribosomes exhibit only slight activity. The latter activity is probably due to the presence of a small fraction of monosomes still containing mRNA. Poly-U stimulates amino acid incorporation only in the single ribosomes.<Cell Division, Centrifugation, Density Gradient, Microscopy, Electron, Protein Biosynthesis, RNA, Messenger, analysis, Ribosomes, analysis, Saccharomyces, analysis, Spectrophotometry
16035642<Morphological and biochemical studies of isolated mitochondria from fetal, neonatal, and adult liver and from neoplastic tissues.<A combined morphological and biochemical investigation of mitochondria from developing and rapidly growing tissues ( tumors, fetal, and very early neonatal rat liver) revealed mitochondria which were deficient in respiratory control, showed no valinomycin induced K(+) accumulation or spontaneous Ca(++) uptake, and were unable to undergo a swelling-contraction cycle. Electron microscopic examination of fetal and neonatal livers and a mammary tumor revealed mitochondria which differed from controls with respect to matrix density and ability to undergo reversible structural changes. The importance of isolation and assay media in interpretation of results is emphasized.<Animals, Animals, Newborn, Anti-Bacterial Agents, pharmacology, Biological Transport, Active, drug effects, Calcium, metabolism, Female, Fetus, Liver, cytology, Male, Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental, pathology, Microscopy, Electron, Mitochondria, metabolism, Oxygen Consumption, Potassium, metabolism, Pregnancy, Rats
16035643<The mechanism of action of colchicine. Colchicine binding to sea urchin eggs and the mitotic apparatus.<Colchicine forms a complex in vivo with a protein present in fertilized or unfertilized sea urchin eggs; similar binding was obtained in vitro with the soluble fraction from egg homogenates. Kinetic parameters and binding equilibrium constant were essentially the same in vivo and in vitro. The binding site protein was shown to have a sedimentation constant of 6S by zone centrifugation. The protein was present in extracts of the isolated mitotic apparatus at a concentration which was several times higher than in whole-egg homogenates. It was extracted from the mitotic apparatus at low ionic strength under conditions which lead to the disappearance of microtubules. No binding could be detected to the 27S protein, previously described by Kane, which is a major protein component of the isolated mitotic apparatus. The properties of the colchicine-bindinG protein, (binding constant, sedimentation constant, Sephadex elution volume) are similar to those obtained with the protein from mammalian cells, sea-urchin sperm tails, and brain tissue, and thus support the conclusion that the protein is a subunit of microtubules.<Animals, Cell Division, drug effects, Centrifugation, Zonal, Chromatography, Gel, Colchicine, metabolism, pharmacology, Echinodermata, Female, Fertilization, Kinetics, Organoids, Ovum, drug effects, Protein Binding, Proteins, metabolism, Tritium
16035644<Isolation of a protein subunit from microtubules.<Sea-urchin sperm tails (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) were obtained by amputation in synthetic sea water and were purified by differential centrifugation. Most of the arms of the outer nine doublets and soluble matrix proteins were removed by this treatment. The central pairs of microtubules were dissolved by dialysis against EDTA at pH 7.5. The extract contained essentially a single component, with a sedimentation constant of 6S, in amounts sufficient to account for the protein content of the central pairs. Incubation of the extract with colchicine-(3)H gave binding levels approaching 0.5-1.0 mole of colchicine per 10(5) g protein. Sucrose-gradient analysis showed that the bound-radioactivity profile coincided with the optical-density profile of the 6S protein. It is concluded that the 6S colchicine-binding protein is a subunit of microtubules.<Animals, Centrifugation, Density Gradient, Colchicine, metabolism, Dialysis, Echinodermata, analysis, Electrophoresis, Male, Microscopy, Electron, Organoids, analysis, Protein Binding, Proteins, analysis, Spermatozoa, analysis, Tritium
16035645<A structural analysis of the myelin sheath in the central nervous system.<The cerebral white matter of rats subjected to a variety of noxious experimental conditions was examined in the electron microscope. Several unusual configurations of the myelin sheath are identified in addition to the usual configuration. These variations include the presence of (a) formed organelles within the inner and outer loops, (b) isolated islands of cytoplasm in unfused portions of the major dense lines, (c) apparently unconnected cell processes between the sheath and the axon, and (d) concentric, double myelin sheaths. A generalized model of the myelin sheath based on a hypothetical unrolling of the sheath is described. It consists of a shovel-shaped myelin sheet surrounded by a continuous thickened rim of cytoplasm. Most of the unusual myelin configurations are explained as simple variations on this basic theme. With the help of this model, an explanation of the formation of the myelin sheath is offered. This explanation involves the concept that myelin formation can occur at all cytoplasmic areas adjacent to the myelin proper and that adjacent myelin lamellae can move in relation to each other.<Animals, Central Nervous System, cytology, Microscopy, Electron, Models, Theoretical, Myelin Sheath, cytology, Rats
16035646<Electron microscope studies of the microvilli of HeLa cells.<Microvilli of HeLa cells cultured in vitro were preserved for electron microscopic examination at different stages of routine cultivation procedures. By a double-embedding technique, vertical sectioning for electron microscopy was possible. It revealed that, although the microvilli were present on all sides of the cell in the dispersed stage and in the attached stage, they were not present on the bottom of the cell when it was stretched on the surface of the dish. When the cells were grown in dense colonies, they were found on top of each other, and microvilli were present on all sides, except on the bottom surface of those cells in contact with the dish. We achieved a more dramatic demonstration of the microvilli by developing a surface-replica technique which retains their spatial arrangement and permits characterization of the distribution of their number, length, and diameter.<Culture Techniques, HeLa Cells, Humans, Microscopy, Electron
16035647<Intracellular transport of secretory proteins in the pancreatic exocrine cell. I. Role of the peripheral elements of the Golgi complex.<It has been established by electron microscopic radioautography of guinea pig pancreatic exocrine cells (Caro and Palade, 1964) that secretory proteins are transported from the elements of the rough-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to condensing vacuoles of the Golgi complex possibly via small vesicles located in the periphery of the complex. To define more clearly the role of these vesicles in the intracellular transport of secretory proteins, we have investigated the secretory cycle of the guinea pig pancreas by cell fractionation procedures applied to pancreatic slices incubated in vitro. Such slices remain viable for 3 hr and incur minimal structural damage in this time. Their secretory proteins can be labeled with radioactive amino acids in short, well defined pulses which, followed by cell fractionation, makes possible a kinetic analysis of transport. To determine the kinetics of transport, we pulse-labeled sets of slices for 3 min with leucine-(14)C and incubated them for further +7, +17, and +57 min in chase medium. At each time, smooth microsomes ( = peripheral elements of the Golgi complex) and rough microsomes ( = elements of the rough ER) were isolated from the slices by density gradient centrifugation of the total microsomal fraction. Labeled proteins appeared initially (end of pulse) in the rough microsomes and were subsequently transferred during incubation in chase medium to the smooth microsomes, reaching a maximal concentration in this fraction after +7 min chase incubation. Later, labeled proteins left the smooth microsomes to appear in the zymogen granule fraction. These data provide direct evidence that secretory proteins are transported from the cisternae of the rough ER to condensing vacuoles via the small vesicles of the Golgi complex.<Animals, Autoradiography, Biological Transport, physiology, Carbon Isotopes, Centrifugation, Density Gradient, Cytoplasm, metabolism, Dogs, Endoplasmic Reticulum, metabolism, Golgi Apparatus, metabolism, Guinea Pigs, In Vitro Techniques, Leucine, metabolism, Male, Mice, Microscopy, Electron, Microsomes, metabolism, Pancreas, metabolism, Proteins, metabolism, Rats, Secretory Rate
16035648<Intracellular transport of secretory proteins in the pancreatic exocrine cell. II. Transport to condensing vacuoles and zymogen granules.<In the previous paper we described an in vitro system of guinea pig pancreatic slices whose secretory proteins can be pulse-labeled with radioactive amino acids. From kinetic experiments performed on smooth and rough microsomes isolated by gradient centrifugation from such slices, we obtained direct evidence that secretory proteins are transported from the cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum to condensing vacuoles of the Golgi complex via small vesicles located in the periphery of the complex. Since condensing vacuoles ultimately become zymogen granules, it was of interest to study this phase of the secretory cycle in pulse-labeled slices. To this intent, a zymogen granule fraction was isolated by differential centrifugation from slices at the end of a 3-min pulse with leucine-(14)C and after varying times of incubation in chase medium. At the end of the pulse, few radioactive proteins were found in this fraction; after +17 min in chaser, its proteins were half maximally labeled; they became maximally labeled between +37 and +57 min. Parallel electron microscopic radioautography of intact cells in slices pulse labeled with leucine-(3)H showed, however, that zymogen granules become labeled, at the earliest, +57 min post-pulse. We assumed that the discrepancy between the two sets of results was due to the presence of rapidly labeled condensing vacuoles in the zymogen granule fraction. To test this assumption, electron microscopic radioautography was performed on sections of zymogen granule pellets isolated from slices pulse labeled with leucine-(3)H and subsequently incubated in chaser. The results showed that the early labeling of the zymogen granule fractions was, indeed, due to the presence of highly labeled condensing vacuoles among the components of these fractions.<Animals, Autoradiography, Biological Transport, physiology, Carbon Isotopes, Cattle, Centrifugation, Density Gradient, Cytoplasm, metabolism, Endoplasmic Reticulum, metabolism, Golgi Apparatus, metabolism, Guinea Pigs, Leucine, metabolism, Mice, Microscopy, Electron, Microsomes, metabolism, Pancreas, metabolism, Pancreatic Juice, Proteins, metabolism, Secretory Rate, Tritium
16035649<The pathway between hyaloid blood and retinal neurons in the toad. Structural observations and permeability to tracer substances.<The hyaloid vessels form a capillary network on the inner surface of the retina. These capillaries are embedded in the vitreous humor, and they lack a glial investment. The intercellular spaces of the retina communicate with the ocular cavity, as can be evidenced by following the penetration of tracer substances. Hence, there is an extracellular diffusion pathway between hyaloid capillaries and retinal neurons, without interposition of glial cells. Trypan blue and ferrocyanide were not detected within the vitreous humor nor the retina after systemic injection. To this extent, at least, the hyaloid capillaries functionally resemble central nervous system capillaries. Intravascular injections of horseradish peroxidase established the absence of vesicular transfer across the endothelium of the hyaloid capillaries. In addition, quintuple-layered junctions between endothelial cells prevented the intercellular passage of the enzyme. It is likely, therefore, that the only pathway across the endothelium of the hyaloid capillaries is through the plasmalemma of the endothelial cells.<Animals, Anura, cytology, Capillaries, physiology, Capillary Permeability, physiology, Neuroglia, cytology, Peroxidases, Retina, blood supply, innervation, Vitreous Body

Three types of inclusions have been observed in both viruliferous and "virus-free" insects. Two of them, alpha and beta, are free in the cytoplasm and are of two different basic configurations: one exhibits bilateral symmetry, the other a fivefold radial symmetry.

The response of normal lymphocytes infected in vitro was also inhibited. The results suggest that early association of lymphocytes with virus inhibits the function of the cell and contributes to persistent carrying of virus in congenital rubella.

Stimulation of contralateral midbrain reticular formation during the inactive phase failed to induce the typical increase in discharge rate of somatosensory thalamic neurons, but produced desynchronization in unaffected cortex. These results indicate that corticothalamic discharge is necessary for sustaining the ongoing activity of deafferented somatosensory thalamic neurons and for maintaining their responsiveness to stimulation of the reticular formation.<Animals, Cats, Cortical Spreading Depression, Electric Stimulation, Neurons, physiology, Pia Mater, drug effects, Potassium Chloride, pharmacology, Reticular Formation, physiology, Thalamus, physiology

The purpose of the present experiment was to demonstrate that, when water is freely available, nonthirsty rats will press a lever for thirst. Three satiated rats, bearing permanently implanted electrodes, were trained to press a lever which caused stimulation to be applied to an area of the lateral hypothalamus which induces thirst. The animals were tested with and without water available. Two of the rats pressed the lever to induce thirst only when water was available. Thus, thirst-inducing stimulation was not rewarding by itself, but only in combination with drinking.<Animals, Behavior, Animal, Drinking, Electric Stimulation, Hypothalamus, physiology, Psychophysiology, Rats, Reward, Self Stimulation, Thirst
16036449<A family planning clinic in a county hospital.<In Sacramento County a family planning clinic was organized and its services made available, within defined limits, to women eligible for county hospital service. In the first year of operation, one morning a week, the clinic served 542 women, examining them, giving advice and helping in the selection of means of contraception. Three hundred and fifteen patients selected oral contraceptives and 211 chose to use an intrauterine device. The problems with the intrauterine device were minimal. At one point 32 per cent of the people taking oral contraceptives were failing to return for refilling their prescription. Experience with the operation of the clinic showed shortcomings in the plan that was being used and pointed the way to improvements.<California, Community Health Services, Family Planning Services, Female, Humans, Pregnancy, Social Work
16036451<North American blastomycosis in California.  Diagnosis of a case and a survey with 28 California observed cases.<North American blastomycosis is not seen often in California. An exhaustive survey uncovered records of only 28 cases. It is believed that this disease does not occur naturally in California and that a careful study of the history will reveal that a residence or visit to a known endemic area can be found.A chart summarizing the results of complement fixation and skin tests for coccidioidomycosis, North American blastomycosis, and histoplasmosis in the 28 cases is included. Use of all three antigens is recommended in cases where there is a difficult diagnostic pulmonary problem, even though there is occasional occurrence of cross-reactions between the three antigens. Finally, an appeal is made to be aware of other mycotic diseases non-edemic to this state.<Adult, Blastomycosis, California, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged
16036453<An exercise program for shoulder disability.<In disabling conditions of the shoulder the involvement is either primary or secondary in origin. The primary disabilities are usually caused by sudden direct trauma or repeated minor traumata. Bursitis, tendonitis, and minor tears of the rotator cuff may result. The disabilities which arise secondarily are more difficult to treat and may have prolonged sequelae. Cervical radiculitis, infectious mononeuritis, cardiac disease, and cerebrovascular disease are common sources for secondary shoulder involvement. Pain and limitation of motion with loss of function are the presenting symptoms. The selection of a proper program of therapy is determined by the diagnosis. Primary conditions are responsive to the usual physical measures of moist heat, ultrasound, and the common exercises. Injections of local anesthestics or steroids and use of deep x-ray therapy may also be effective. The disabilities which arise secondarily are more difficult to treat and often become chronic and intolerably painful. In the author's experience, the most effective treatment for the secondarily induced shoulder problem is the combined use of moist heat of mild intensity, manual mobilization, neuromuscular facilitation, and a suitable home program of appropriate exercise.<Exercise Therapy, Humans, Joint Diseases, therapy, Physical Therapy Modalities, Shoulder Joint
16036454<Unsuspected carcinoma found histologically after minor anorectal operations.<The unsatisfactory results of radical operations in advanced anal cancer could be bettered by earlier diagnosis of the malignant lesion. The possibility of cancer should always be kept in mind when treating any of the common chronic anal diseases. Preliminary biopsy studies should be done more frequently if suspicious lesions are present and all tissues removed during minor anorectal operations should always be examined by a pathologist. Each surgical specimen should be labeled to show the site from which it was removed. Follow-up care of the patient would be simplified if the exact site of cancer origin could be identified.A recent ten-year survey of minor anorectal surgical procedures at the University of California Medical Center showed clinically unsuspected anal cancer found in 2 per cent of cases on tissue examination by the pathologist. The cancers were generally early and of the keratinizing squamous cell and nonkeratinizing varieties.<Adult, Aged, Anus Neoplasms, etiology, Female, Fissure in Ano, etiology, Hemorrhoids, surgery, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Rectal Diseases, surgery, Rectal Neoplasms, etiology

16036517<The changes in chemical composition during development of the bovine nuchal ligament.<Whole bovine nuchal ligaments, or portions thereof (in the case of commercially valuable animals), were obtained from 45 animals (28 fetal and 17 postnatal) ranging in age from 110 days of gestation to 10 yr. Insoluble elastin was quantitatively prepared from the fresh ligaments by extraction with hot alkali and by a combination of multiple extractions with alkaline buffer and then repeated autoclaving. When adult samples were examined, the yields of insoluble residue by these two methods were very similar, but with young fetal samples the second method gave significantly higher values, because of incomplete purification of the elastin residue. The changes in the concentration of collagen, alkali-insoluble elastin, and DNA have been examined. DNA concentration, and, thus, cell population density, fell progressively during the fetal period of development, to reach a steady value soon after birth. Collagen appeared in appreciable quantities before elastin, but its concentration was rapidly halved at about the time of birth. Insoluble elastin concentration was low until the end of the 7th fetal month, at which time it began to rise rapidly. The rate of increase in elastin concentration remained high throughout the next 10-12 wk, by which time the adult value had been reached. Quantitative studies, on the basis of the whole ligament, showed that the total cell content rises to a maximum at birth, but falls soon after to a level about half that at birth. Total collagen production and elastin deposition continue at a steady, maximal rate over the interval from 235 days of gestation to the end of the 1st postnatal month. It is concluded that the immediate postnatal period would be the most favorable phase in which to attempt the isolation of the soluble precursor elastin.<Amino Acids, analysis, Animals, Animals, Newborn, Cattle, Collagen, analysis, Connective Tissue, analysis, DNA, analysis, Elastin, analysis, Fetus, Ligaments, analysis, growth &amp; development, Organ Size
16036518<Histological changes during the development of the bovine nuchal ligament.<The histological changes occurring during the development of the bovine nuchal ligament have been observed in sections of formalin-fixed material from 21 animals ranging in age from 110 days of gestation to 10 yr. The elastic fibers which constitute the bulk of the adult ligament were initially few in number. During fetal development, the fibers showed a rapid increase both in number and in their stainability with the usual elastic stains. The average diameter of these elastic fibers increased only slowly until the last uterine month, at which time it began to increase very rapidly. This rapid rate of increase continued through the first 6 postnatal months, after which the rate of increase slowed markedly. However, the fiber diameter continued to rise steadily throughout the period of the study. During the fetal stage of development, the fibroblastic cells of the ligament exhibited unusual nuclear appearances which distinguish them from other fibroblasts. These consisted of marked clumping of the chromatin and an associated nuclear vacuolation or vesiculation. While these changes seem likely to be artefacts of fixation, their temporal correlation with elastin deposition and their demonstration in other tissue cells engaged in elastin production suggest that the factors responsible for these appearances may be related to elastin synthesis.<Animals, Animals, Newborn, Cattle, Collagen, metabolism, Elastic Tissue, metabolism, Elastin, metabolism, Female, Fetus, Histocytochemistry, Ligaments, analysis, growth &amp; development, Pregnancy
16036519<DNA replication patterns and chromosomal protein synthesis in opossum lymphocytes in vitro.<DNA replication patterns were determined in the autosomes and sex chromosomes of phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes from the opossum (Didelphis virginiana) by employing thymidine-(3)H labeling and high-resolution radioautography. Opossum chromosomes are desirable experimental material due to their large size, low number (2n = 22), and morphologically distinct sex chromosomes. The autosomes in both sexes began DNA synthesis synchronously and terminated replication asynchronously. One female X chromosome synthesized DNA throughout most of the S phase. Its homologue, however, began replication approximately 3.5 hr later. The two X's terminated DNA synthesis synchronously, slightly later than the autosomes. This form of late replication, in which one X chromosome begins DNA synthesis later than its homologue but completes replication at the same time as its homologue, is apparently unique in the opossum. The male X synthesized DNA throughout S while the Y chromosome exhibited late-replicating characteristics. The two sex chromosomes completed synthesis synchronously, slightly later than the autosomes. Grain counts were performed on all chromosomes to analyze trends in labeling intensity at hourly intervals of S. By analyzing the percent of labeled mitotic figures on radioautographs at various intervals after introduction of arginine-(3)H, chromosomal protein synthesis was found not to be restricted to any portion of interphase but to increase throughout S and into G(2).<Animals, Arginine, metabolism, Autoradiography, Cell Division, Chromosomes, metabolism, DNA, metabolism, Female, In Vitro Techniques, Karyotyping, Lectins, pharmacology, Lymphocytes, metabolism, Male, Marsupialia, Protein Biosynthesis, Sex Chromatin, metabolism, Thymidine, metabolism, Tritium
16036520<Chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA in a brown alga Egregia menziesii.<Chloroplasts and mitochondria of the brown alga Egregia menziesii were studied with the electron microscope. In both organelles, 15-25-A fibrils with DNA characteristics are found within areas of electron transparency. In each chloroplast there are two DNA-containing areas, one at each tip of the chloroplast. This localization, the shape and size of each DNA-containing area, and its close association with lamellae in a nondividing chloroplast are noted. One or occasionally two DNA-containing areas are found within the mitochondrion and they are compared with a similar structure in the chloroplast.<Cell Nucleus, Cell Wall, Chloroplasts, analysis, DNA, analysis, Eukaryota, analysis, Histocytochemistry, Microscopy, Electron, Mitochondria, analysis
16036521<A comparative study on the fine structure of the basalar muscle of the wing and the tibial extensor muscle of the leg of the lepidopteran Achalarus lyciades.<Basalar and tibial extensor muscle fibers of Achalarus lyciades were examined with light and electron microscopes. Basalar muscle fibers are 100-150 micro in diameter. T-system membranes and sarcoplasmic reticulum make triadic contacts midway between Z lines and the middle of each sarcomere. The sarcoplasmic reticulum is characterized by a transverse element situated among myofilaments halfway between Z lines in every sarcomere. The morphology of Z lines, hexagonal packing of thin and thick myofilaments, and thin/thick myofilament ratios are similar to those of fast-acting insect muscles. Tibial extensor muscle fibers are 50-100 micro in diameter. Except for a lack of the transverse element, the T system and sarcoplasmic reticulum are similar to those of basalar muscle. Wavy Z lines, lack of a hexagonal packing of myofilaments, and larger thin/thick myofilament ratios are similar to those of other postural muscles of insects. The morphology of basalar and tibial extensor muscle is compared to that of other insect muscle with known functions, and reference is made to the possible contribution of the transverse element of sarcoplasmic reticulum in basalar flight muscle to speed and synchrony in this muscle.<Animals, Cell Membrane, Endoplasmic Reticulum, Insecta, cytology, Microscopy, Microscopy, Electron, Mitochondria, Muscles, cytology, Myofibrils
16036522<A study of the innervation of the taenia coli.<An electrophysiological and anatomical study of the guinea pig taenia coli is reported. Changing the membrane potential of single cells cannot modulate the rate of firing action potentials but does reveal electrical coupling between the cells during propagation. The amplitude of the junction potentials which occur during transmission from inhibitory nerves is unaffected in many cells during alteration of the membrane potential, indicating electrical coupling during transmission. The taenia coli is shown to consist of smooth muscle bundles which anastomose. There are tight junctions between the cells in the bundles, and these probably provide the pathway for the electrical coupling. The smooth muscle cells towards the serosal surface of the taenia coli are shown electrophysiologically to have an extensive intramural inhibitory innervation, but a sparse sympathetic inhibitory and cholinergic excitatory innervation. These results are in accordance with the distribution of these nerves as determined histochemically. As single axons are only rarely observed in the taenia coli, it is suggested that the only muscle cells which undergo permeability changes during transmission are those adjacent to varicosities in the nerve bundles. The remaining muscle cells then undergo potential changes during transmission because of electrical coupling through the tight junctions.<Action Potentials, Animals, Electrophysiology, Female, Guinea Pigs, Male, Membrane Potentials, Muscle, Smooth, innervation, physiology, Muscles, cytology, Taenia, anatomy &amp; histology
16036523<Thermal depolarization of fluorescence from polytene chromosomes stained with acridine orange.<The degree of polarization of fluorescence from stretched Chironomus thummi polytene chromosomes, stained with low concentrations of acridine orange (AO), decreases with increasing temperature. The "half temperature" of this decrease (T((1/2)R)) is lower than the expected DNA thermal denaturation temperature (T(m)) by about 20 degrees C. T((1/2)R) is lowered as histone is removed from chromosomes. Balbiani ring regions of the fourth chromosome have T((1/2)R)'s much lower than other regions, and nearly as low as chromosomes which had been extensively pretreated with trypsin to remove histone and other proteins. Measurements of the thermal change in the rotational diffusion rate of AO in solution with DNA indicate that the temperature at which the DNA-AO bonding changes from a "rigid" to a "loose" mode varies with the GC percentage of the DNA, and in the same fashion as T(m), although 20 degrees C lower.<Acridines, Animals, Chemical Phenomena, Chemistry, Physical, Chromosomes, DNA, Diptera, Fluorescence, Microscopy, Fluorescence, Salivary Glands, Temperature
16036524<Intramitochondrial filamentous bodies in the thick limb of henle of the rat kidney.<"Intramitochondrial filamentous bodies" (IMFB) were occasionally found within the matrix of some mitochondria of the thick limb of Henle of the rat kidney, but not elsewhere in the tubular system. Three types were recognized: type I, an accumulation of filaments 55 A thick; type II, a bundle of parallel filaments having the same thickness as those of type I and regular spacing, 87 A apart, from center to center; and type III, consisting of type II with regular light bands of 280 A periodicity and a helical border of prismatic tubular cristae. In addition to these, electron-opaque masses showing variable and faint substructures were found in the matrix of mitochondria. It is suggested that all these IMFB may originate from mitochondrial cristae and that type II IMFB may be an intermediate developmental form between type I and type III. After uranyl acetate staining, IMFB and the membranes of prismatic tubular cristae showed highly increased electron opacity. The literature has been reviewed for reports of intramitochondrial filamentous inclusions in various types of cells. These inclusions have been classified according to their structural characteristics and the localization in the mitochondria and compared with IMFB reported herein.<Animals, Kidney Tubules, cytology, Microscopy, Electron, Mitochondria, Rats
16036525<An electron microscopic study of nuclear elimination from the late erythroblast.<The process of expulsion of the nucleus during the transformation of the late erythroblast to reticulocyte is described. Erythroid clones taken from the spleen of lethally irradiated mice transplanted with syngeneic bone marrow were used. 10-12-day old isolated clones were fixed in glutaraldehyde, then in osmium tetroxide. Ultra-thin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and/or lead citrate before examination. Late (orthochromatic) erythroblasts develop pseudopod-like cytoplasmic protrusions into one of which the nucleus gradually penetrates, being deformed by the extrusion through the relatively narrow passage. During the whole process, mitochondria and vesicular and membranous elements are concentrated in the cytoplasm. Once outside the cell, the nucleus reassumes its rounded form. It is surrounded by a narrow rim of cytoplasm and structurally altered plasma membrane and is connected to the rest of the cell by a bridge. Elongated vacuoles appear within this bridge, with a resulting release of the enveloped nucleus which is soon phagocytized by macrophages; this leaves behind the newly formed reticulocyte. During this process, the cytoplasmic protrusions, the agglomeration of mitochondria, and the mode of separation of the nucleus from the rest of the cell are similar to those occurring in mitotic division.<Animals, Cell Differentiation, Cell Division, Cell Nucleus, Clone Cells, Cytoplasm, Erythrocytes, Golgi Apparatus, Mice, Mitochondria, Reticulocytes
16036526<Proteins in nucleocytoplasmic interactions. I. The fundamental characteristics of the rapidly migrating proteins and the slow turnover proteins of the Amoeba proteus nucleus.<By the transplantation of amino acid-(3)H-labeled nuclei between cells and the subsequent isolation of nuclei for quantitative assay, we have confirmed that all the nuclear proteins of Amoeba proteus are divisible into two classes that are sharply defined by their physiological behavior. About 40% of the proteins in the nucleus rapidly migrates back and forth between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. These rapidly migrating proteins (RMP) are 25-50 times more concentrated in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm, and migration into the nucleus therefore occurs against a high concentration differential. The remaining 60% of nuclear proteins has been classified as slow turnover proteins (STP) since (as reported in a following paper) virtually all of them ultimately undergo turnover. Turnover in this context means loss of label from the nucleus, by either protein breakdown or protein migration to the cytoplasm. Isolation of nuclei in the detergent Triton X-100 results in a 20% loss of nuclear proteins but conclusions about RMP and STP were not found to be significantly affected by this loss.<Amino Acids, metabolism, Amoeba, metabolism, Animals, Autoradiography, Cell Nucleus, metabolism, Cytoplasm, metabolism, Nucleoproteins, metabolism, Tritium
16036527<DNA synthesis and mitosis in erythropoietic cells.<Studies of newt (Triturus or Diemictylus viridescens) erythropoietic cells showed that DNA synthesis and mitosis normally occur throughout most of the developmental process. Mitotic divisions were found in all immature precursor stages from the proerythroblast to the highly hemoglobinized reticulocyte. Mitoses were absent in mature erythrocytes. Radioautographic examination of thymidine-(3)H incorporation into DNA revealed that all erythroid cells except the mature erythrocyte were labeled. Microphotometric measurements of Feulgen-stained smears showed that all immature stages were undergoing DNA synthesis whereas the mature erythrocyte was inactive. The results obtained from three independent methods clearly demonstrate that (a) no loss of DNA or of chromosomes occurs during erythrocytic development and (b) highly hemoglobinized and, therefore, well-differentiated cells normally do undergo DNA synthesis and mitosis.<Animals, Autoradiography, Cell Division, Cell Nucleus, metabolism, Cytoplasm, metabolism, DNA, biosynthesis, Erythrocytes, metabolism, Erythropoiesis, physiology, Photometry, RNA, biosynthesis, RNA, Messenger, biosynthesis, Reticulocytes, metabolism, Thymidine, metabolism, Tritium, Urodela
16036528<Evidence for regulation of protein synthesis at the translation level in response to dietary alterations.<Rats were maintained for several days on a protein-free diet which, approximately 14 hr before decapitation, was changed to a protein-rich diet. Microsomal subfractions of liver were obtained by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The sedimentation patterns of the microsomal subfractions and of the polysomes were found to be unchanged after the alteration of the diet whereas the ability to incorporate amino acid was markedly enhanced. No significant differences in the RNA/protein ratio of the microsomal subfractions were observed. The changes in amino acid incorporation which were unrelated to concurrent changes in the amount of polysomes are discussed.<Amino Acids, metabolism, Animals, Carbon Isotopes, Centrifugation, Density Gradient, Dietary Proteins, pharmacology, Endoplasmic Reticulum, Female, Leucine, metabolism, Liver, cytology, Microsomes, metabolism, Protein Biosynthesis, RNA, metabolism, RNA, Messenger, metabolism, Rats, Ribosomes, metabolism
16036529<Relation of tobacco mosaic virus to the host cells.<The relation of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) to host cells was studied in leaves of Nicotiana tabacum L. systemically infected with the virus. The typical TMV inclusions, striate or crystalline material and ameboid or X-bodies, which are discernible with the light microscope, and/or particles of virus, which are identifiable with the electron microscope, were observed in epidermal cells, mesophyll cells, parenchyma cells of the vascular bundles, differentiating and mature tracheary elements, and immature and mature sieve elements. Virus particles were observed in the nuclei and the chloroplasts of parenchyma cells as well as in the ground cytoplasm, the vacuole, and between the plasma membrane and the cell wall. The nature of the conformations of the particle aggregates in the chloroplasts was compatible with the concept that some virus particles may be assembled in these organelles. The virus particles in the nuclei appeared to be complete particles. Under the electron microscope the X-body constitutes a membraneless assemblage of endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes, virus particles, and of virus-related material in the form of wide filaments indistinctly resolvable as bundles of tubules. Some parenchyma cells contained aggregates of discrete tubules in parallel arrangement. These groups of tubules were relatively free from components of host protoplasts.<Biological Transport, Cell Membrane, Cell Nucleus, Cell Wall, Chloroplasts, Cytoplasm, Endoplasmic Reticulum, Microscopy, Microscopy, Electron, Mitochondria, Organoids, Plants, Toxic, Protoplasts, Ribosomes, Tobacco, cytology, Tobacco Mosaic Virus
16036530<High-resolution electron microscopic analysis of the amyloid fibril.<The ultrastructural organization of the fibrous component of amyloid has been analyzed by means of high resolution electron microscopy of negatively stained isolated amyloid fibrils and of positively stained amyloid fibrils in thin tissue sections. It was found that a number of subunits could be resolved according to their dimensions. The following structural organization is proposed. The amyloid fibril, the fibrous component of amyloid as seen in electron microscopy of thin tissue sections, consists of a number of filaments aggregated side-by-side. These amyloid filaments are approximately 75-80 A in diameter and consist of five (or less likely six) subunits (amyloid protofibrils) which are arranged parallel to each other, longitudinal or slightly oblique to the long axis of the filament. The filament has often seemed to disperse into several longitudinal rows. The amyloid protofibril is about 25-35 A wide and appears to consist of two or three subunit strands helically arranged with a 35-50-A repeat (or, less likely, is composed of globular subunits aggregated end-to-end). These amyloid subprotofibrillar strands measure approximately 10-15 A in diameter.<Amyloidosis, pathology, Humans, Microscopy, Electron, Microscopy, Polarization, Spleen, pathology
16036536<The esophageal propulsive force: esophageal response to acute obstruction.<The response of the normal human esophagus to an obstructing intraluminal bolus was investigated and compared to the response evoked by transient intraluminal distention. A balloon, immobilized within the esophagus by external attachment to a force transducer, was inflated with from 3 to 25 ml of air for from 3 to 210 sec. Pressure phenomena occurring in the esophagus were simultaneously recorded from the body of the esophagus above and below the balloon. Transient distention (5 sec or less) with small volumes (5 ml or less) often evoked a secondary peristaltic wave in the esophagus distal to the balloon, but infrequently resulted in the registration of any force exerted upon the balloon to drive it downward. Conversely, distentions of longer duration and with greater volume elicited an esophageal propulsive force exerted upon the balloon oriented to propel it aborally, and much less often evoked a propagated wave of secondary peristalsis. The propulsive force, obviously resulting from esophageal muscular contraction, occurred promptly, and once initiated, was sustained until deflation of the balloon. It varied widely in magnitude, from 4 to 200 g, and was associated with no motor phenomena recorded from the body of the esophagus proximal or distal to the balloon which could account for its presence, onset, magnitude, or duration. The force was inhibited by deglutition, but arrival of the primary peristaltic wave at the bolus resulted in augmentation of the force. When the obstructing balloon was freed from its attachment, the persistent, stationary force was converted to a propagated one that propelled the balloon before it. It the balloon was arrested before entering the stomach, the moving contraction was also arrested and the persistent propulsive force acting upon the balloon was maintained. The velocity of the moving contraction wave was determined in great part by the resistance offered by the bolus. Unrestrained, the balloon was propelled aborally at 4-8 cm/sec by the esophageal propulsive force; when restrained by 50 g, the rate of passage was reduced to 0.2-0.8 cm/sec. The esophageal response to intraluminal distention is thus not limited to the uninterrupted wave of secondary peristalsis but is versatile and is determined by the nature of the distending bolus. Transient distention by a mobile or collapsible bolus elicits the propagated secondary peristaltic wave.<Adult, Deglutition, physiology, Esophagus, physiology, Female, Gastrointestinal Motility, Humans, Male, Muscle Contraction, Muscle, Smooth, physiology
16036537<Regional myocardial blood flow.<A method is described which measures the local effectiveness of the myocardial circulation, expressed as a clearance constant. Uniform clearance constants have been demonstrated in the normal canine and human myocardium. A distinct difference in clearance constants has been demonstrated between the normal canine myocardium and areas of naturally occurring disease. Heterogeneous clearance constants have been found in a majority of human subjects with coronary artery disease-the lowest rates being noted in areas of fibrous aneurysm.<Aneurysm, physiopathology, Animals, Blood Circulation, Coronary Disease, physiopathology, Coronary Vessels, physiology, physiopathology, Dogs, Humans, Krypton, Radioisotopes, Regional Blood Flow, physiology
16036538<Studies of the metabolic activity of leukocytes from patients with a genetic abnormality of phagocytic function.<Polymorphonuclear leukocytes from patients with chronic granulomatous disease respond to the phagocytosis of latex particles with normal increments in glucose consumption, lactate production, Krebs' cycle activity, and lipid turnover. The leukocytes of these patients fail to show normal increments in respiration, direct oxidation of glucose, and hydrogen peroxide formation during particle uptake. It appears that the stimulation of respiration with the formation of hydrogen peroxide and stimulation of the direct oxidative pathway of glucose metabolism are closely linked to degranulation and intracellular killing of bacteria by polymorphonuclear leukocytes.<Citric Acid Cycle, Glycolysis, Granuloma, genetics, Humans, In Vitro Techniques, Lactates, biosynthesis, Leukocytes, metabolism, Lipid Metabolism, Lymphatic Diseases, metabolism, Oxidation-Reduction, Phagocytosis
16036539<Difference in hepatic metabolism of long- and medium-chain fatty acids: the role of fatty acid chain length in the production of the alcoholic fatty liver.<Replacement of dietary triglycerides containing long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) by triglycerides containing medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA) markedly reduced the capacity of alcohol to produce fatty liver in rats. After 24 days of ethanol and MCFA, the increase in hepatic triglycerides was only 3 times that of controls, whereas an 8-fold rise was observed after ethanol and LCFA. The triglyceride fatty acids that accumulated in the liver after feeding of ethanol with MCFA contained only a small percentage of the MCFA; their composition also differed strikingly from that of adipose lipids. To study the mechanism of the reduction in steatosis, we compared oxidation to CO(2) and incorporation into esterified lipids of (14)C-labeled chylomicrons or palmitate-(14)C (representing LCFA), and of octanoate-(14)C (as MCFA) in liver slices and isolated perfused livers, in the presence or absence of ethanol. Ethanol depressed the oxidation of all substrates to CO(2); MCFA, however, was much more oxidized and reciprocally much less esterified than LCFA, with a 100-fold difference in the ratio of esterified lipid-(14)C to (14)CO(2). Furthermore, in hepatic microsomal fractions incubated with alpha-glycerophosphate, octanoate was much less esterified than palmitate. This propensity of MCFA to oxidation rather than esterification represents a likely explanation for the reduction in alcoholic steatosis upon replacement of dietary LCFA by MCFA.<Animals, Carbon Dioxide, biosynthesis, Carbon Isotopes, Chylomicrons, Dietary Fats, Ethanol, pharmacology, Fatty Acids, metabolism, Fatty Acids, Nonesterified, metabolism, Fatty Liver, chemically induced, In Vitro Techniques, Liver, metabolism, Oxidation-Reduction, Rats, Triglycerides
16036540<Qualitative and quantitative analysis of urinary lipids in the nephrotic syndrome.<A qualitative and quantitative analysis of urinary lipids in the nephrotic syndrome is presented. The following lipids were identified in the urine of patients with the nephrotic syndrome: free cholesterol, cholesterol esters, triglycerides, free fatty acids, and phospholipids. Glass paper chromatography identified the cholesterol esters as palmitate, oleate, linoleate, and arachidonate, and identified the phospholipids as phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylserine. Urinary lipid excretion was much greater in patients with the nephrotic syndrome than in patients with chronic renal disease and minimal proteinuria, or in patients with hyperlipidemia from other causes. Urinary lipid excretion varied widely among the 13 patients with the nephrotic syndrome studied, and no quantitative correlation with serum lipid levels was observed. However, qualitatively at least, the proportion of cholesterol esters excreted in the urine was similar to the proportion of these esters in plasma. A good correlation was found between lipid excretion and glomerular permeability. Furthermore, during steroid therapy urinary lipid excretion decreased concomitant with a decrease in proteinuria. All these observations support the idea that lipiduria in the nephrotic syndrome is related to protein loss and that most of the lipid in the urine enters the glomerular filtrate in the form of lipoproteins.<Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Arachidonic Acids, urine, Cholesterol, urine, Chromatography, Paper, Fatty Acids, urine, Female, Humans, Linoleic Acids, urine, Lipids, urine, Male, Middle Aged, Nephrotic Syndrome, urine, Oleic Acids, urine, Palmitic Acids, urine, Phospholipids, urine, Triglycerides, urine

Recovery of washed axons is faster in those that had been treated with saxitoxin than it is in those that were treated with tetrodotoxin.

No egg mortality during cultivation, nor any slowing of development could be detected in either experiment. It may be presumed that the mortality of mouse ova during the period before implantation has no essential effect on the resulting fertility. During cultivation of oviducts for 144 hours, there occurred in most blastocysts herniation of their walls resulting in a formation similar to the blastocyst, and a migration of a disorganized mass of cells, some of which resembled the giant trophoblastic cells. After transplantation of ova fertilized in vitro to recipients, in four cases there occurred nidation and subsequent normal development of the embryo.<Animals, Culture Techniques, Embryo, Mammalian, Female, Fertilization, Male, Mice, Oviducts, cytology, Ovum, cytology, transplantation

The illusion is probably limited to small visual angles (about 2 degrees).<Automobile Driving, Depth Perception, Humans, Illusions
16037864<Induced hypersensitivity to barbital in the female rat.<Female rats, treated with two daily anesthetic doses of barbital, exhibit 1 month later a significant increase in sleeping time over that of control animals. Hypersensitive animals, as compared to controls, show no alteration in liver weight (as percentage of body weight), but they manifest a significant shortening of time for induction of anesthesia. Induced hypersensitivity to barbiturates is apparently not the result of alterations in the metabolism of these agents, but it may be related to enhanced susceptibility of the central nervous system to these drugs.<Animals, Barbiturates, Central Nervous System, drug effects, Enzyme Induction, Female, Hypersensitivity, Delayed, chemically induced, Liver, enzymology, Organ Size, Rats, Sleep, chemically induced
16038015<Influence of phospholipase C on some electrical properties of the skeletal muscle membrane.<1. A study was made of the effects of phospholipase C (PhC) on the resting membrane potential, input resistance, action potential and acetylcholine sensitivity of innervated and chronically denervated single muscle fibres of the rat.2. In doses higher than 1.5 mug/ml. PhC significantly increased the ionic permeability of the muscle membrane (indicated by a fall in input resistance) and reduced the resting membrane potential of innervated fibres. The ;fast' or ;white' extensor digitorum longus muscle was the most sensitive and the ;slow' or ;red' soleus the least sensitive muscle. A similar difference was observed among ;fast' and ;slow' muscles of the chicken, the posterior latissimus dorsi being far more sensitive than the ;slow' anterior latissimus dorsi muscle. Chronically denervated muscles were more resistant to these actions of PhC than innervated ones but even after denervation the ;fast' muscles remained more sensitive than the ;slow' muscles.3. The action-potential generating mechanism in the ;fast' and ;slow' muscle was completely and irreversibly blocked by 1.5 mug/ml. of PhC within 1 hr. Furthermore the innervated and chronically denervated muscles were equally sensitive to this effect of PhC. The enzyme caused a gradual increase in the threshold for excitation, reduction in the rate of rise and the amplitude of the action potential. The input resistance and the resting membrane potential were not reduced by this dose of PhC.4. Acetylcholine sensitivity of chronically denervated muscles was not affected by PhC in doses that abolished the electrical excitability of the membrane. When PhC reduced the input resistance and the resting membrane potential a decrease was also observed in the response to applied acetylcholine.5. The results suggest that PhC by acting at the polar heads of membrane phospholipids interferes with the ionic carrier mechanism which generates the action potential. The differences in sensitivity between ;fast' and ;slow' muscles and between innervated and chronically denervated ones are tentatively explained on the basis of heterologous membrane phospholipids and/or variations in their stereochemical arrangement.<Acetylcholine, pharmacology, Action Potentials, Animals, Cell Membrane Permeability, drug effects, Denervation, Electrophysiology, In Vitro Techniques, Membrane Potentials, Membranes, drug effects, Muscles, drug effects, innervation, Neuromuscular Junction, drug effects, Phospholipases, pharmacology, Poultry, Rats
16038016<Spatial interaction in human cone vision.<1. The adaptation state of a uniformly illuminated patch of human cone retina was determined by finding the threshold for a small, brief light spot seen flashing in its centre.2. When the illuminated patch of the retina is increased in diameter, the adaptation state is first raised, and beyond a critical background diameter, lowered.3. This is interpreted as a manifestation of excitatory and inhibitory interaction of adaptation stimuli: illumination of retinal regions in the immediate neighbourhood of the area tested acts to raise the adaptation level, and of those further removed acts to lower it.4. The critical area beyond which adapting light produces inhibition is about 5 min of arc in diameter in the eye's object space for foveal observation. For peripheral cone vision it increases much as the minimum angle of resolution.5. The inhibiting action of outlying areas is substantially reduced, or perhaps even eliminated, by lowering the background luminance.6. Surrounding the retinal patch with a pair of juxtaposed narrow concentric black and white rings superimposed on a uniform field, simulating a border, irrespective of diameter, does not influence the threshold of the probing spot. This argues against a possible threshold raising effect of the border of the background.7. The inhibiting action on a patch of cone retina of a surrounding annulus occurs only when the annulus is seen by the same eye and not when it is seen by the other eye: the site of inhibitory interaction is, therefore, retinal.<Adaptation, Physiological, Humans, Photoreceptor Cells, physiology, Retina, physiology, Vision, Ocular, physiology, Visual Fields
16038017<Actions of calcium and certain multivalent cations on potassium contracture of guinea-pig's taenia coli.<1. Using a calcium buffer system, the effect of severe calcium lack on the shape of K-contracture of the guinea-pig's taenia coli was studied. Under conditions of calcium lack, the initial phasic response was preferentially affected and it disappeared completely at concentrations below 10(-7)M, while the ensuing tonic response persisted, though considerably diminished in size, even at the concentration of 10(-8)M.2. In calcium-free media, various multivalent cations, which according to Frank (1962) can support the K-contracture of a skeletal twitch muscle fibre in calcium-free solution, augmented the remaining tonic response, but did not restore the phasic response, when it was eliminated in calcium free environment.3. When K-contractures were induced in normal calcium media, these cations produced, in contrast, an abolition of the phasic response together with a partial depression of the tonic phase. They also inhibited a part of the fully developed contracture. The last effect was no longer obtainable in calcium-free media.4. It is concluded that the phasic response and a part of the tonic response of taenia coli depend upon the extracellular calcium for their initiation (and also for maintenance of tension in the case of the latter) and that the rest of the tonic response draws on a store of ;bound' calcium for its evolution.<Animals, Cadmium, pharmacology, Calcium, pharmacology, Colon, drug effects, Electrophysiology, Guinea Pigs, In Vitro Techniques, Manganese, pharmacology, Membrane Potentials, Muscle Contraction, drug effects, Muscle, Smooth, drug effects, Potassium, pharmacology
16038019<Motor activity following the silent period in human muscle.<1. When a muscle is unloaded during voluntary contraction, there is normally a silent period in the electromyogram. The silence is terminated by a sudden return of muscle action potentials.2. In order to investigate the mechanism of the terminal motor volley, the unloading reflex was studied in six human subjects. The independent variables were the initial muscular force, the inertia of the limb and the amount of motion permitted. The dependent variables were the size and latency of the terminal volley.3. During isometric contraction, the amplitude of the surface-recorded muscle action potentials increased monotonically with increasing muscular tension.4. The action potentials were significantly larger during the terminal volley than during the period before unloading.5. When acceleration of the limb was reduced by increasing the inertia, the terminal volley was decreased in size, but the latency was not affected.6. When movement was interrupted by a mechanical block, the latency of the terminal volley was reduced, but the size was not affected.7. The results suggest that the terminal motor volley is not the result of a decrease in Renshaw feed-back or in autogenetic inhibition.8. The motor volley must be regulated by proprioceptive feed-back, because it is affected by the velocity and displacement of the limb.9. The muscle frequently responded within 20 msec after motion of the limb was blocked. Hence it appears that the mechanism involves a spinal reflex.10. Because the motor discharge occurs while the muscle is shortening, it cannot be an ordinary stretch reflex. If the discharge is attributed to spindle afferent driving, one must assume that the gamma motor neurones are active during the silent period.11. The authors postulate a fusimotor reflex, which is driven by afferent impulses from the moving limb and excites the alpha motoneurones by way of the ;gamma loop'.<Action Potentials, Adult, Electromyography, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Motor Neurons, physiology, Muscle Contraction, physiology, Muscles, physiology, Reflex
16038018<Release of neurohypophysial hormones in vitro.<1. The rate of release of neurohypophysial hormones in vitro, using isolated, halved neural lobes of the rat in an incubation medium containing excess K(+) and Ca(2+), was measured. The highest average rate of release was observed between 10 and 20 min after commencement of incubation.2. Incubation of isolated, halved rat neural lobes in the presence of acetylcholine, with or without eserine, did not stimulate hormone release. When complete isolated hypothalamo-neurohypophysial systems were incubated in a suspension medium containing 10(-7) mg/ml. acetylcholine a significant increase in the release of oxytocin occurred (P &lt; 0.01); the increase in vasopressin release was less pronounced (P &lt; 0.05).3. Uptake of O(2) by the isolated, halved neural lobes and the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial systems continued for 2-3 hr, i.e. in excess of the experimental incubation time.4. During the first 40 min of incubation the control halved neural lobes increased in weight; the neural lobes incubated in buffer containing high potassium and calcium showed no increase in weight.5. Neural lobes incubated in buffer containing excess K(+) and Ca(2+) contained about 3 times as much potassium as controls. The sodium content was not affected significantly.6.

16038020<The in vitro transfer of bovine immune lactoglobulin across the intestine of new-born pigs.<1. Everted sacs of pig intestine, used soon after birth, maintained transmural potentials and transferred water and glucose to the serosal surface.2. Immune globulin, fed as bovine colostrum to the new-born pig, appeared in the serosal fluid of everted sacs during incubation in bicarbonate saline. The particular segment showing maximum transferring ability varied between limits and appeared to depend on the amount or concentration of colostrum fed to the pig. Sacs from unfed pigs incubated in bovine colostrum also transferred colostral IgG to the serosal fluid. This transfer was dependent on the concentration of colostral IgG in the incubation medium and became more pronounced in the middle third of the small intestine.3. Human serum albumin inhibited the transfer of colostral IgG and about twenty molecules of albumin were transferred for every molecule of colostral IgG, when both were presented together in equal concentration on the basis of weight, to the middle segment of the small intestine.4. Some of the immune globulin collected in vitro after feeding bovine colostrum was found in a degraded form, but the amounts present could not be estimated. There was no apparent degradation of immune globulin in the purely in vitro experiments.5. The in vitro transfer of bovine colostral IgG showed selectivity between molecules of albumin and colostral IgG, the nature of which warrants further study.<Animals, Animals, Newborn, Biological Transport, Colostrum, metabolism, Glucose, metabolism, Immune Sera, metabolism, Immunoelectrophoresis, In Vitro Techniques, Intestinal Mucosa, metabolism, Intestine, Small, metabolism, Lactoglobulins, metabolism, Serum Albumin, pharmacology, Swine
16038021<The intestinal absorption of pig and bovine immune lactoglobulin and human serum albumin by the new-born pig.<1. Homologous and heterologous colostral immune globulins and human serum albumin were fed to new-born pigs and an attempt was made to estimate the amounts appearing subsequently in serum.2. All three proteins, fed separately in large amounts to different pigs, appeared in the serum in low concentration about 45 min after feeding, and then rose quickly to a high level. No difference could be detected between the amounts absorbed when equal amounts had been fed but there was a wide variation between pigs. Previous dialysis of pig colostrum against bicarbonate saline did not affect the rate or amount of pig immune globulin absorbed after feeding.3. When pig and bovine colostral IgG were fed together at equal concentrations in bovine colostrum, the absorption of pig IgG was greater than that of bovine IgG. Human serum albumin, added to bovine colostral IgG in bovine colostrum, was absorbed readily and this did not interfere significantly with the absorption of bovine colostral IgG.4. The efficiency with which the pig intestine absorbed bovine colostral IgG depended on the dose and/or concentration fed, increasing as the dose fed was increased to 2 g and remaining constant for higher doses.5. Some of the absorbed immune globulin was shown to exist in a partly degraded form.6. The process of protein transfer across the intestine of the new-born pig may select, to a limited degree, between different proteins, but the digestion of protein shown to take place and the large variation between individual pigs makes interpretation of these results uncertain.<Animals, Animals, Newborn, Cattle, Humans, Immune Sera, metabolism, urine, Immunoelectrophoresis, Intestinal Absorption, physiology, Lactoglobulins, metabolism, Rabbits, Serum Albumin, metabolism, Swine
16038022<Body temperature responses in cats and rabbits to the monoamine oxidase inhibitor tranylcypromine.<1. In unanaesthetized cats tranylcypromine (1-10 mg/kg) had scarcely any effect on rectal temperature when injected intraperitoneally, yet such injections prevented the deep and long-lasting fall in rectal temperature which normally occurs when the cat is anaesthetized by intraperitoneal pentobarbitone sodium or intravenous chloralose. The anaesthesia itself, however, was not affected. In some of the experiments with pentobarbitone sodium rectal temperature even rose to fever level.2. In anaesthetized as well as in unanaesthetized cats injections of tranylcypromine (0.1-1 mg) into the cerebral ventricles caused a rise in rectal temperature.3. In rabbits, rectal temperature was scarcely affected when surgical anaesthesia was produced by intravenous infusions of pentobarbitone sodium under the same condition in which, in cats, intraperitoneal pentobarbitone sodium produced a deep and long-lasting fall in temperature, i.e. when no external heat was applied but excessive dissipation of heat was prevented by placing the rabbit on a cotton-wool pad. However, when it was placed on the metal surface of an operating table, the anaesthesia was associated with a deep fall in rectal temperature.5. In anaesthetized and unanaesthetized rabbits tranylcypromine had no effect on rectal temperature when injected intraperitoneally (10 mg/kg) or into the cerebral ventricles (1 mg).5. These results are discussed in relation to the theory that the three monoamines in the hypothalamus, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), adrenaline and noradrenaline, act as central transmitters in temperature regulation.<Animals, Blood Pressure, Body Temperature, Body Temperature Regulation, drug effects, Cats, Epinephrine, pharmacology, Female, Hypothalamus, physiology, Male, Norepinephrine, pharmacology, Pentobarbital, pharmacology, Rabbits, Respiration, Serotonin, pharmacology, Tranylcypromine, pharmacology
16038023<The time course of the effect of thyroid hormones upon basal oxygen consumption and plasma concentration of free fatty acid in rats.<1. Basal O(2) consumption and plasma free fatty acid (FFA) concentration were measured in normal and hypothyroid rats at various intervals after the initiation of a course of treatment with thyroid hormones.2. A significant rise in basal O(2) consumption was detectable in both groups of rats before there was any change in plasma FFA level.3. It is concluded that the stimulatory effect of thyroid hormones on the basal O(2) consumption of the whole animal is not mediated entirely by a rise in plasma FFA level.<Animals, Fatty Acids, blood, Hypothyroidism, Male, Oxygen Consumption, drug effects, Rats, Thyroid Gland, physiology, Thyroid Hormones, pharmacology, Thyroxine, pharmacology, Triiodothyronine, pharmacology
16038024<Some observations on 'autoregulatory escape' in cat intestine.<1. ;Autoregulatory escape' (Folkow, Lewis, Lundgren, Mellander &amp; Wallentin, 1964a) in which intestinal blood flow escapes from the constrictor influence of splanchnic nerve stimulation, was investigated in the cat. Measurements were made of intestinal blood flow, movements and portal venous pH and oxygen content.2. ;Autoregulatory escape' was observed with sympathetic nerve stimulation and noradrenaline infusion. It did not occur during haemorrhage.3. The recovery of flow during noradrenaline infusion could not be explained by changes in intestinal motility or loss of effect of noradrenaline due to changes in portal venous hydrogen ion concentration.4. During a noradrenaline infusion there was a reduction in oxygen consumption associated with a fall in blood flow. During the period of ;autoregulatory escape', however, oxygen consumption increased.

16038025<Excitation of afferent cardiac sympathetic nerve fibres during myocardial ischaemia.<1. Occlusion of the main left coronary artery of lightly anaesthetized cats provoked a pseudaffective reaction. The afferent pathway was in the cardiac sympathetic nerves.2. The compound action potential evoked in the inferior or middle cardiac nerves by stimulation of the thoracic sympathetic trunk contained two elevations, a small Adelta wave and a much larger sC wave. Occasionally a B wave was present.3. During coronary occlusion, the Adelta elevation was reduced by 35-55%, indicating afferent activity in these fibres. Multifibre preparations also showed increased afferent discharge during occlusion.4. It seems probable that the afferent activity in these fibres was mainly responsible for signalling the pseudaffective response elicited by coronary occlusion.5. Myocardial ischaemia produced by coronary occlusion was probably the stimulus for the increased activity.<Action Potentials, physiology, Animals, Cats, Coronary Disease, physiopathology, Coronary Vessels, innervation, Electric Stimulation, Heart Conduction System, physiology, Stellate Ganglion, physiology, Sympathetic Nervous System, physiology, Vagotomy, Vagus Nerve, physiology
16038026<The innervation of sheep mesenteric veins.<1. An isolated preparation of sheep mesenteric vein is described from which contractions of the longitudinal smooth muscle of the adventitia have been recorded in response to stimulation of intramural and periarterial nerves.2. The preparation did not respond to single stimuli but the relation between amplitude of response and frequency of stimulation was characteristic of that described for other smooth muscles innervated by sympathetic nerves.3. Responses were blocked by tetrodotoxin, guanethidine, and by a number of alpha-receptor blocking drugs. Responses to peri-arterial stimulation were unaffected by hexamethonium. It was concluded that the longitudinal smooth muscle is supplied with post-ganglionic noradrenergic motor nerves and the presence of such fibres in the adventitia was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy.4. Acetylcholine also caused contractions. Although a direct excitatory action on the smooth muscle could not be excluded, results suggest that acetylcholine may release noradrenaline from the axons of the sympathetic ground plexus.<Acetylcholine, pharmacology, Animals, Atropine, pharmacology, Cocaine, pharmacology, Electric Stimulation, Guanethidine, pharmacology, Hexamethonium Compounds, pharmacology, In Vitro Techniques, Isoproterenol, pharmacology, Mesenteric Veins, innervation, Muscle Contraction, drug effects, physiology, Muscle, Smooth, innervation, Norepinephrine, pharmacology, Ouabain, pharmacology, Sheep, Sympathetic Nervous System, physiology, Tetrodotoxin, pharmacology, Vasomotor System, physiology

The distribution of [(14)C]sucrose within the plantaris muscle of the rat has been examined by suspending muscles in oxygenated Ringer containing this marker and subsequent analysis of the muscle.2. Histological examination of sections of muscle treated in this way indicates considerable distortion of muscle fibre pattern; this has been held to cast doubt upon the validity of such a method as a means of extracellular space examination.3. The rate of K(+) loss from muscles under these conditions has been examined by flame photometry. Up to 50% of the original muscle K(+) has been shown to be lost by efflux within approximately 1 hr from the commencement of soaking.4. It is considered that these findings indicate severe deterioration in the physiological condition of the muscle, and it is suggested that tissue hypoxia is chiefly responsible for this.<Animals, Carbon Isotopes, Extracellular Space, In Vitro Techniques, Muscles, analysis, anatomy &amp; histology, metabolism, Potassium, analysis, Rats, Sucrose, metabolism
16038028<Studies on the mechanism of kinin formation in inflammation.<1. Injection of autologous plasma into the subcutaneous space leads to kinin formation in man. Kinin formation was also observed after similar injections of homologous plasma in the rat, dog and guinea-pig. The material withdrawn from the subcutaneous tissue following the injection of plasma was characterized as kinin by inhibition of its formation with trasylol, by inactivation with chymotrypsin and by its pharmacologic effects.2. Kinins were also demonstrated in subcutaneous tissue following injections of compound 48/80, a histamine liberator.3. A slightly acid pH greatly favours the accumulation of kinins in subcutis.4. Human plasma kallikrein was not activated in vitro by histamine, serotonin, nicotonic acid or endotoxin. Human polymorphonuclear leukocytes initiated the formation of kinins in plasma.5. It is suggested that in inflammation, ;primary mediators' such as histamine, do not activate plasma kallikrein directly, but rather increase vascular permeability, permitting plasma to enter the extravascular space where conditions for activation exist. Kinin accumulation is enhanced in inflammation where pH is slightly lowered.<Animals, Biological Assay, Dogs, Endotoxins, pharmacology, Guinea Pigs, Histamine, pharmacology, Humans, In Vitro Techniques, Inflammation, Kinins, biosynthesis, Leukocytes, Nicotinic Acids, pharmacology, Rats, Serotonin, pharmacology, p-Methoxy-N-methylphenethylamine, pharmacology
16038167<Indoleacetic acid oxidase activity of apoperoxidase.<The conventional activity of electrophoretically purified horseradish peroxidase toward guaiacol, pyrogallol, 2,6-dimethoxyphenol, and benzidine is abolished by removal of the heme prosthetic group with a mixture of cold acetone and hydrogen chloride. The apoenzyme, though devoid of peroxidase activity, retains its activity as an indoleacetic acid oxidase when it is supplied with 10(-5) mole of manganous ion and 2,4-dachlorophenol per liter. This oxidase activity is cyanide-sensitive; azide also inhibits under specific conditions of both pH and cofactor concentration. Partial restoration of the peroxidase activity by recombination of apoprotein with heme produces no effect on the oxidase activity, except that cofactors are no longer absolutely required. Therefore, it appears that the activity of peroxidase as an indoleacetic acid oxidase need not directly involve the heme prosthetic group, or that manganous ions and dichlorophenol can substitute for the heme group in the reaction between indoleacetic acid and oxidase.<Azides, pharmacology, Biphenyl Compounds, metabolism, Cyanides, metabolism, Guaiacol, metabolism, Heme, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Indoleacetic Acids, metabolism, Kinetics, Manganese, Oxidoreductases, metabolism, Peroxidases, metabolism, Phenols, metabolism, Plants, Edible, enzymology, Pyrogallol, metabolism

These residues occur in linear sequence in normal beta-chains in a region involved in heme-globin binding. A deletion of five amino acids in the beta-chains of hemoglobin Gun Hill is postulated.

16038556<Stereospecific analysis of triglycerides: an alternative method.<A new method for the stereospecific analysis of triglycerides is demonstrated on a corn oil which had been analyzed by an earlier method. The triglyceride (1,2,3-triacyl L-glycerol) was partially degraded by means of methyl magnesium bromide. The 1,3-diglyceride was then isolated, and converted into l-2-phosphatidyl phenol, from which phospholipase A cleaved the fatty acids from position 1. The remaining lysophosphatide was analyzed to yield the fatty acids at position 3 of the original triglyceride. The fatty acid composition of position 2 was determined after hydrolysis of the corn oil with pancreatic lipase. This method has the advantage over the one reported previously of yielding direct analyses of the fatty acids in each of the three positions.<Chromatography, Thin Layer, Fatty Acids, analysis, Glycerides, analysis, Oils, analysis, Phospholipases, Triglycerides, analysis
16038558<Acetate-1-14C incorporation into polyunsaturated fatty acids of phospholipids of developing chick brain.<The incorporation of acetate-1-(14)C into the polyunsaturated fatty acids of glycerophosphatides of chick embryonic brain has been studied. After the injection of acetate-1-(14)C into the yolk sac, differences were found in the degree of labeling of the major fatty acids of the omega3 and omega6 series. Arachidonic acid (20:4omega6) showed a high degree of radioactivity while docosahexaenoic acid (22:6omega3) was poorly labeled, at a period of brain development when both fatty acids were being actively deposited. Evidence is presented to indicate that the low activity in docosahexaenoic acid is not explicable on the basis of either a low or high rate of turnover of this polyenoic acid. Similar results were obtained whether the rapid early or slower late stage of brain development was examined. It is suggested that the elongation of omega3 and omega6 series acids may be under the control of different regulatory mechanisms.<Acetates, metabolism, Animals, Brain, metabolism, Carbon Isotopes, Chick Embryo, Fatty Acids, Essential, biosynthesis, Phospholipids, metabolism
16038557<Rates of tissue uptake of palmitic acid-1-14C complexed with albumin by two different procedures.<The effect was investigated of two different methods of preparing an albumin-palmitic acid complex on the tissue uptake of the palmitic acid, both in vivo and in vitro. Complex A was prepared by exposing monomolecular layers of palmitic acid-1-(14)C deposited on a solid surface to albumin dissolved in buffer. Complex B was prepared by the interaction of albumin with a micellar solution of palmitate-1-(14)C. The radioactivities and chemical compositions of the two complexes were almost identical. Rat epididymal fat pads took up, during a 1 hr incubation, about 2.5 times as much palmitic acid from complex A as from complex B; the extent of esterification of the incorporated label was equal for the two complexes. The fractional turnover rate of palmitic acid of complex A, administered intravenously to dogs, was about twice that of palmitic acid from complex B. The label of the two complexes recirculated in the esterified fatty acid fraction of plasma to an equal extent. It is proposed that differences in the orientation of the fatty acid molecules may affect their interaction with the binding sites of albumin and that the metabolic differences of the resulting complexes are related to differences in the ease of transfer of the fatty acid from the complex to receptor sites of tissues.<Adipose Tissue, metabolism, Animals, Carbon Isotopes, Dogs, Epididymis, Male, Palmitic Acids, metabolism, Rats, Serum Albumin, metabolism, Serum Albumin, Bovine, metabolism

The 2-trans acids are prepared by LiAlH(4) reduction of a suitable polyenoic fatty acid ester to the alcohol, formation of the tosylate, oxidation to the aldehyde, and Doebner condensation of the latter with malonic acid. The 3-hydroxy acids are obtained by reaction of the acyl chloride of a suitable polyenoic acid with the sodium enolate of methyl acetoacetate and sodium methoxide to give the 3-keto ester, the keto group of which is reduced with sodium borohydride to the alcohol. These procedures were applied to the synthesis of eicosa-2-trans-8, 11, 14-all cis-tetraenoic acid-3-(14)C and DL-3-hydroxy eicosa-8, 11, 14-trienoic acid-3-(14)C.<Chemistry, Organic, Chromatography, Thin Layer, Fatty Acids, Malonates, Organic Chemistry Phenomena, Oxidation-Reduction, Spectrum Analysis
16038560<Dietary fat and cholesterol and serum cholesterol in the gerbil.<Groups of gerbils were fed purified diets containing either 10 or 20% of safflower, olive, or coconut oil. Each diet was fed without cholesterol and with 0.1 and 0.2% of added cholesterol. The animals were bled after 2, 4, and 8 wk for the determination of the level of serum cholesterol. The major factors affecting the level of serum cholesterol were the kind of dietary oil, the amount of dietary cholesterol, and the length of time the diet was fed. The level of safflower oil had a statistically significant effect but the level of olive or coconut oil had no significant effect. Various other statistically significant interactions were observed which make simple interpretations of the data difficult. The levels of serum cholesterol achieved in the gerbils fed the different oils with no or very low levels of dietary cholesterol were similar to those seen in men fed the same oils. Although the gerbil is apparently resistant to the development of atherosclerosis, it may be a useful model for studying the effect of dietary fats upon cholesterol metabolism.<Animals, Cholesterol, analysis, pharmacology, Dietary Fats, metabolism, pharmacology, Male, Oils, pharmacology, Rodentia
16038561<Influence of calcium, cholesterol, and unsaturation on lecithin monolayers.<Surface pressures and potentials of mixed monolayers of dicetyl phosphate-cholesterol, dipalmitoyl lecithin-cholesterol, egg lecithin-cholesterol, and phosphatidic acid-cholesterol were measured. The surface potential is shown to be a more reliable parameter for the study of interactions in monolayers than the surface pressure. Monolayers of dicetyl phosphate-cholesterol follow the additivity rule for area/molecule whereas lecithin-cholesterol monolayers deviate from it. The reverse is true for the additivity rule with regard to surface potential/molecule. Thus, the surface potential indicates that there is no interaction (or complex formation) between lecithin and cholesterol, but that there is ion-dipole interaction between dicetyl phosphate and cholesterol, as well as between phosphatidic acid and cholesterol. The apparent condensation of mixed monolayers of lecithin when cholesterol is added is explained by a consideration of molecular cavities or vacancies caused by thermal motion of the fatty acyl chains, the size of these cavities being influenced by the length and degree of saturation (especially the proportion of monounsaturation) of the fatty acyl chains and the extent of compression of the monolayer. The cholesterol molecules occupy these cavities and therefore cause no proportional increase in area/molecule in the mixed monolayers. Monolayers are liquefied by the presence of cholesterol as well as of unsaturated fatty acyl chains; in contrast, Ca(++)tends to solidify lecithin monolayers. The available evidence suggests that cholesterol can both impart fluidity to the monolayer and occupy the molecular cavities caused by the fatty acyl chains.<Calcium, Chemical Phenomena, Chemistry, Cholesterol, Fats, Unsaturated, Phosphatidylcholines, Phospholipids, Pressure
16038563<Gas-liquid chromatography of 2-chloroethyl esters using a detector specific for halogens.<The gas-liquid chromatography of 2-chloroethyl derivatives of short- and long-chain monocarboxylic acids, and of short-chain dicarboxylic acids and aldehydes has been studied with a dual-flame ionization detector that provided simultaneous records of the concentrations of chlorine and of total organic material in the column effluent. The chloroethyl derivatives of dicarboxylic acids and aldehydes could be distinguished from the chloroethyl esters of monocarboxylic acids on the basis of different ratios of responses of the two detectors. Analysis of a mixture of chloroethyl derivatives prepared from a natural product revealed that several compounds that might ordinarily have been identified as unsaturated or branched-chain fatty acid esters on the basis of their retention times had the higher chlorine content characteristic of chloroethyl derivatives of aldehydes or dicarboxylic acids.<Chemical Phenomena, Chemistry, Chemistry, Organic, Chlorine, analysis, Chromatography, Gas, Fatty Acids, analysis, Organic Chemistry Phenomena
16038562<The ionic structure of lecithin monolayers.<Surface potentials of mixed monolayers of dicetyl phosphate and eicosanyl trimethylammonium bromide (1:1) were the same on subsolutions of 0.02 M NaCl or 0.01 M CaCl(2), which indicated that ionic phosphate does not interact with Ca(++) in the presence of a neighboring trimethylammonium group. Surface potential-pH plots of dicetyl phosphate, and of dipalmitoyl, egg, and dioleoyl lecithins showed that as the pH of the subsolution is decreased the phosphate groups in the monolayer are neutralized in the order: dicetyl phosphate &gt; dipalmitoyl lecithin &gt; egg lecithin &gt; dioleoyl lecithin. The binding of cations (Na(+), Ca(++)) to the phosphate group of lecithin also showed the same order. The binding of Ca(++)) to egg phosphatidic acid monolayers, as measured by the increase in surface potential, is considerably greater than that to egg lecithin. These results suggest that there is an internal salt linkage between the phosphate and trimethylammonium groups on the same lecithin molecule. An increase in unsaturation of fatty acyl chains increases the intermolecular spacing, which reduces the ionic repulsion between polar groups, and hence strengthens the internal salt linkage. The results support the concept of a vertical rather than coplanar orientation of the phosphoryl choline group with respect to the interface. A position has been proposed for Ca(++) in the dipole lattice of lecithin from a consideration of the surface potential measurements.<Calcium, Chemical Phenomena, Chemistry, Cholesterol, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Phosphatidylcholines, Pressure, Quaternary Ammonium Compounds, Sodium
16038564<The plasma free fatty acid rebound induced by nicotinic acid.<The time course of the nicotinic acid-induced changes in levels of plasma free fatty acids (FFA) was examined. The plasma FFA response of fasted dogs to graded doses of nicotinic acid was shown to be biphasic: an initial depression of the level of plasma FFA was followed by a rebound elevation to supernormal levels. FFA rebound was not seen after the administration of the nicotinic acid homologue, pyridylacetic acid, or a variety of nicotinic acid metabolities. A similar pattern of FFA response was observed in fasted, normal rats. Adrenalectomy did not abolish the secondary elevation of FFA but did cause a somewhat delayed response. Hypophysectomy modified the time course of the response-the initial FFA decrease was prolonged-and the intensity of the FFA rebound was diminished. No rebound was observed in hypophysectomized, adrenalectomized rats. In normal rats, nicotinic acid caused a significant rise in the level of plasma corticosterone. A normal rebound pattern was observed in thyroidectomized rats. Reserpine, administered on a schedule designed to deplete catecholamine stores, altered the time course of plasma FFA changes only slightly. The results indicate that both the pituitary and adrenal functions are required for the expression of the rebound phenomenon after nicotinic acid administration.<Adrenalectomy, Animals, Catecholamines, metabolism, Corticosterone, blood, Dogs, Fatty Acids, blood, Hypophysectomy, Male, Nicotinic Acids, pharmacology, Rats, Reserpine, pharmacology
16038566<Metabolism of doubly-labeled chylomicron cholesteryl esters in the rat.<Chylomicrons labeled in vitro with doubly-labeled cholesteryl esters were injected intravenously into fasted rats, and the tissue distribution and chemical form of each isotope were observed for 24 hr. The use of doubly-labeled cholesteryl esters provided information about the metabolism of both the sterol and the fatty acid moieties. Similar results were obtained with doubly-labeled cholesteryl palmitate, oleate, and linoleate. In each instance, most (80-90%) of the chylomicron cholesteryl ester was removed from the plasma by the liver; small amounts were also taken up by all other tissues examined. There was no hydrolysis during uptake. In the liver the newly absorbed cholesteryl esters underwent slow hydrolysis (60% after 1 hr and 85-90% after 3.5 hr); the rate of reesterification of the liberated cholesterol was still slower. After 24 hr only 20-28% of the labeled cholesterol present in the animal was found in the liver. Labeled fatty acid disappeared from the liver, and was redistributed among other tissues, much more rapidly than the labeled cholesterol. Most of the labeled fatty acid apparently underwent oxidation, since only 15-20% of the injected labeled fatty acid was present in the animal after 24 hr. At this time the three fatty acids were differently distributed between and within the tissues. These differences reflected some known differences of fatty acid concentration and lipid composition in the various tissues.<Adipose Tissue, metabolism, Adrenal Glands, metabolism, Animals, Carbon Isotopes, Cholesterol, blood, metabolism, Chylomicrons, metabolism, Erythrocytes, metabolism, Fatty Acids, metabolism, Kidney, metabolism, Liver, metabolism, Male, Rats, Tritium
16038565<Properties, composition, and structure of stearic acid-stearate monolayers on alkaline earth solutions.<Interactions between alkaline earth ions and the carboxylate ligand in a stearic acid surface film have been investigated by IR spectrophotometry and surface chemical procedures. The frequency and shape of the carboxylate absorption band and the effect of hydration and pH on band characteristics suggest that beryllium, magnesium, and calcium ions form calcium-type complexes with the stearate ligand while strontium and barium ions form both calcium-type complexes and more ionic barium-type complexes, which have lower carboxylate band maxima. Since IR band frequencies in anhydrous calcium-type complexes are directly proportional to the charge/(crystal radius) ratio, it is apparent that covalency decreases in the order: Be &gt; Mg &gt; Ca &gt; Sr &gt; Ba. The decreasing order of stability constants estimated from spectrophotometric titration data, Be &gt; Ca &gt; Mg &gt; Sr &gt; Ba, demonstrates that calcium behaves anomalously. This anomalous behavior is also apparent in the high solid-to-liquid phase transition temperature and small surface area of the calcium-carboxylate film compared to films composed of complexes with the other ions. A geometric factor related to the ionic radius and the radius of the carboxylate binding site formed by a calcium stearate lattice is proposed to explain the unique properties of calcium-carboxylate surface films. Although the beryllium complex has the highest carboxylate band frequency and stability constant, it gives an atypical "expanded" surface film. A hydrogen bonded lattice formed with a soluble beryllium monohydrate is suggested as an explanation for this film property.<Barium, Beryllium, Calcium, Chemical Phenomena, Chemistry, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Magnesium, Pressure, Sodium, Solutions, Spectrophotometry, Stearic Acids, Strontium, Temperature

Development of agriculture causing increased malaria is bound to gene-pool changes causing malaria reduction.<The particular agricultural adaptation we have been considering is the ultimate determinant of the presence of malaria parasites in the intracellular environment of the human red blood cell. This change in the cellular environment is deleterious for normal individuals, but individuals with the sickle-cell gene are capable of changing their red-cell environment so that intense parasitism never develops. Normal individuals suffer higher mortality rates and lower fertility rates in a malarious environment than individuals with the sickle-cell trait do, so the latter contribute proportionately more people to succeeding generations.<Africa, Eastern, Africa, Western, Agriculture, Anemia, Sickle Cell, epidemiology, Anopheles, Computers, Environment, Genetics, Population, Humans, Insect Vectors, Malaria, Malaysia, Models, Theoretical, Tropical Climate
16038687<Lysosomal enzyme inhibition by trypan blue: a theory of teratogenesis.<A mechanism of mammalian teratogenesis involving inhibition of embryotrophic nutrition is suggested and exemplified by the action of trypan blue on pregnant rats. There is evidence for the localization of trypan blue in heterolysosomes of the epithelium of the visceral yolk sac, and our experiments indicate that the dye is an inhibitor of a selection of hydrolytic enzymes present in lysosomal fractions from homogenates of rat visceral yolk sac. It seems likely that trypan blue inhibits the intracellular digestion of embryotroph by the visceral yolk-sac epithelium; the conceptus may therefore be deprived of essential nutrients at critical stages of development.<Abnormalities, Drug-Induced, Acid Phosphatase, metabolism, Animals, Deoxyribonucleases, metabolism, Enzymes, pharmacology, Epithelial Cells, Extraembryonic Membranes, enzymology, Female, Glucuronidase, metabolism, Histocytochemistry, Lysosomes, drug effects, enzymology, Microscopy, Electron, Pregnancy, Pregnancy, Animal, drug effects, Rats, Ribonucleases, metabolism, Trypan Blue, pharmacology

With this technique it has been shown that a 75-minute pulse of light per day, when appropriately positioned with respect to the circadian activity cycle of the sparrow Passer domesticus, is sufficient to produce a response normally produced only by long days. The results cannot be interpreted in terms of a requirement of an absolute amount of either darkness or light and offer strong confirmation of Bünning's hypothesis concerning the mechanism of photoperiodic time measurement.<Animals, Behavior, Animal, Birds, physiology, Circadian Rhythm, Darkness, Light, Male, Organ Size, Testis
16038689<Electrical recordings from meningioma cells during cytolytic action of antibody and complement.<Resting membrane potential and total cell resistance of human meningioma cells in tissue culture have been measured with fine microelectrodes. Addition of either antiserum inactivated with heat or control serum from normal rabbits produced small depolarizations (2 to 4 millivolts) with no discernible ( 5 percent) change in resistance. Addition of antiserums with complement, however, produced larger depolarizations and decreases in resistance before any changes in cell morphology were visible with light microscopy; as cytoplasmic swelling progressed, membrane potential dropped close to zero, and resistance decreased five- to tenfold. The electrical recording technique may be useful in the study of sublethal as well as lethal damage to immune cells and, in particular, may permit temporal resolution of damaging events and repair mechanisms in a single cell.<Antibodies, Complement System Proteins, pharmacology, Culture Techniques, Electrophysiology, Humans, Immune Sera, pharmacology, Membrane Potentials, Meningioma, physiopathology

Only the former fraction exhibits significant ability to synthesize prostaglandins E(1) and F(1)alpha from bis-homo-gamma-linolenic acid. After subfractionation of the crude mitochondrial fraction, prostaglandin E and F material is found mainly in the cholinergic and noncholinergic nerve endings.

The fatty acyl chains of the galactosyl diglycerides are constructed so that they can provide a stable lock-and-key fit with the phytol chains of chlorophyll in such a way as to localize the porphyrin structures of chlorophyll and space them for efficient photoreception.

16039003<Role differentiation in copulating cicada killer wasps.<Copulating male and female cicada killer wasps have distinct behavioral roles independent of reproduction. Males terminate copulation, and females initiate the copulatory flight in which the pair in copulation escape potential danger. Separation and escape behavior are mutually exclusive. Separation occurs because the female clings to the substrate and fails to join the male in his frequent attempts at flight; thus he eventually pulls free. Escape occurs when the female begins flight, which the male readily joins. Differences in thresholds for flight probably largely determine both roles. There appears to be an evolutionary balance in escape and separation behavior determined by the behavior of the female, and illustrative of behavioral homeostasis. The female remains still in the presence of mild stimuli, such as attempted male flights, and thereby aids in separation; she initiates escape in the presence of strong stimuli such as potential enemies.<Animals, Behavior, Animal, Copulation, Female, Homeostasis, Insecta, physiology, Male

Experiments on reaction time to masked signals suggest otherwise, as does a recent demonstration that a masked target can be restored to phenomenal awareness by backward masking of the target's mask. Two experiments are reported here that substantiate the possibility of recovering a masked target, by using different stimulus materials and a more elaborate design than was employed in the first demonstration of this effect.<Humans, Visual Perception

16039186<Community psychiatry and the population explosion.<Although excessive population has long been a dilemma in certain areas of the world, current rates of growth present a global threat to all nations. Arguments based on economics, world peace, individual freedom, humanism and the preservation of life's amenities all point to the urgent need for programs to control birth rates. This applies to the United States also, although we have the advantage of a relatively high cultural and economic level from which to attack the problem. Modern psychiatry is increasingly committed to the Community Mental Health concept, which in part implies greater involvement with the element of the population that is socially and economically at a disadvantage. Effective treatment cannot ignore the effects on the patient of intolerable reality situations, often produced by successive unwanted pregnancies. In addition, a positive approach to family planning by psychiatrists and social workers will provide the structure needed for truly preventive psychiatry; as our knowledge of the determinants of psychosis, delinquency and mental retardation expands, selective counseling can do much to prevent these family and social tragedies. Both as world citizens and as practitioners of a profession, psychiatrists cannot afford to delay pledging their resources to the solution of so compelling a problem.<Community Mental Health Services, Family Planning Services, Humans, Social Work, Psychiatric

16039354<Formation of adenosine cyclic 3',5'-phosphate by nonproliferating cells and cell-free extract of Brevibacterium liquefaciens.<The formation of adenosine cyclic 3',5'-phosphate by Brevibacterium liquefaciens ATCC 14929 was studied with the use of nonproliferating cells and cell-free extract. With nonproliferating cells provided by deprivation of sulfate, the formation of this nucleotide was accelerated by adding some amino acids and sugars. Among amino acids tested, alanine and asparagine were most effective. Pentoses were more favorable than hexoses and other sugars. Formation of adenosine cyclic 3',5'-phosphate was observed also with chloramphenicol-treated cells. Experiments on cell-free extract showed that addition of alanine or pyruvate stimulated the formation of adenosine cyclic 3',5'-phosphate from adenosine-5'-triphosphate. When alanine was added to the cell-free system, shaking of the reaction mixture further increased the amount of the nucleotide, but pyruvate was far more effective than alanine. No synergistic effect of alanine and pyruvate was observed. Some enzyme activity was observed which decomposed adenosine cyclic 3',5'-phosphate, but it was weak as compared with adenyl cyclase activity in the presence of pyruvate. From the results obtained, it appears that pyruvate may act as an activating factor of adenyl cyclase in Brevibacterium liquefaciens.<Adenine Nucleotides, biosynthesis, Alanine, pharmacology, Amino Acids, metabolism, Brevibacterium, drug effects, metabolism, Carbohydrate Metabolism, Chloramphenicol, pharmacology, Chromatography, Thin Layer, Culture Media, Pyruvates, pharmacology, Sulfur, pharmacology

All four requirements probably result from the loss of a single enzyme of the isoleucine-valine pathway. Since similar mutants of Neurospora crassa accumulate acetoin, the present mutant probably forms tetramethylpyrazine from acetoin. Accumulation of tetramethylpyrazine was dependent upon addition of thiamine. This observation is consistent with the known activity of diphosphothiamine as a cofactor for the formation of acetolactate (a precursor of acetoin) from pyruvate.<Corynebacterium, metabolism, Culture Media, Isoleucine, metabolism, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Mutation, Pyrazines, biosynthesis, Thiamine, metabolism, Valine, metabolism
16039356<Identification of fatty acids and aliphatic hydrocarbons in Sarcina lutea by gas chromatography and combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.<The composition and nature of the fatty acids and hydrocarbons of Sarcina lutea were elucidated by gas chromatography and by combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The distribution of fatty acids found in S. lutea showed two families of pairs, or dyads, of saturated monocarboxylic acids (C12-C18) with and without methyl branching. These pairs of fatty acids showed a pattern of iso and anteiso structures for C13, C15, and C17, and iso and normal structures for C12, C14, and C16. Only the C18 showed unsaturation. The distribution of hydrocarbons in the range C22-C29 showed two families of tetrads of unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbons all showing methyl branching. Each tetrad was composed of four isomers identified as two iso olefins and two anteiso olefins. The only difference between the tetrads pertaining to different families was found in the relative gas chromatographic retention times of the last two components of each group.<Chromatography, Gas, Fatty Acids, analysis, Hydrocarbons, analysis, Sarcina, analysis, Spectrum Analysis
16039357<Fatty acid and aliphatic hydrocarbon composition of Sarcina lutea grown in three different media.<Sarcina lutea was grown in Trypticase Soy Broth, Nutrient Broth, and a chemically defined medium. Gas chromatographic analysis of lipid components demonstrated that the composition of the medium had an effect on the relative per cent composition of the aliphatic hydrocarbons and fatty acids present in the cells. The branched olefinic hydrocarbons from the organisms grown in Trypticase Soy Broth showed no predominance or only a slight predominance of odd-numbered carbon chains, whereas the hydrocarbons from cells grown in the other two media showed an obvious predominance of odd-numbered carbon chains. The monocarboxylic fatty acid content and distribution showed only minor differences, with all normal saturated fatty acids present in relatively small quantities for cells grown in Nutrient Broth and in a chemically defined medium.<Chromatography, Gas, Culture Media, Fatty Acids, analysis, Hydrocarbons, analysis, Sarcina, analysis
16039358<14-C incorporation into the fatty acids and aliphatic hydrocarbons of Sarcina lutea.<An initial investigation into the mechanism of hydrocarbon biosynthesis in Sarcina lutea was performed by measuring the amounts of (14)C incorporated into the hydrocarbons and fatty acids by use of a combination gas chromatograph and high-temperature gas-flow ionization apparatus. Uniformly labeled l-isoleucine-(14)C was predominantly incorporated into the anteiso-branched chains. Palmitate-16-(14)C gave evidence that a direct correlation may exist between the nonpolar end of the palmitate and the biosynthesis of hydrocarbons and carotenoids. The label from palmitate-1-(14)C was incorporated into the various hydrocarbon groups as a compound, derived from the polar end of the palmitate, consisting of more than two carbon atoms. Palmitate-16-(14)C and -1-(14)C gave no detectable evidence that transformed products were incorporated into other fatty acids. Sodium acetate-2-(14)C and uniformly labeled l-leucine-(14)C gave evidence of a nonspecific incorporation into both the aliphatic hydrocarbons and fatty acids of Sarcina lutea.<Acetates, metabolism, Bicarbonates, metabolism, Carbon Isotopes, Chromatography, Gas, Chromatography, Thin Layer, Fatty Acids, metabolism, Hydrocarbons, metabolism, Isoleucine, metabolism, Leucine, metabolism, Palmitic Acids, metabolism, Sarcina, metabolism
16039359<Electrophoretic patterns of membrane proteins of Mycoplasma.<Cell membranes of Mycoplasma were isolated either by osmotic lysis or by ultrasonic disruption of the organisms. The membranes were dissolved in phenol-acetic acid-water (2:1:0.5, w/v/v), and membrane proteins were separated electrophoretically in polyacrylamide gels containing 5 m urea and 35% (v/v) acetic acid. The electrophoretic patterns of membrane proteins were highly specific for the different Mycoplasma strains examined. The use of this method to prove the identity or dissimilarity of Mycoplasma strains is suggested.<Bacterial Proteins, analysis, Bacteriolysis, Cell Membrane, analysis, Electrophoresis, Mycoplasma, analysis, Ultrasonics
16039360<Studies of intestinal microflora. VI. Effect of x irradiation on the fecal microflora of the rat.<The effect of sublethal, midlethal, and lethal doses of total-body X irradiation on the fecal microbial population of the rat was studied. No changes were observed in animals receiving sublethal doses of X ray. Midlethal and lethal doses produced an increase in the numbers of fecal coliforms, staphylococci, streptococci, and fungi; these changes were transient in rats that survived, but were more marked and persisted during life in those that died. The possible role of these alterations in intestinal microflora in post-irradiation infection and in death is discussed.<Animals, Enterobacteriaceae, isolation &amp; purification, Feces, microbiology, Fungi, isolation &amp; purification, Intestines, radiation effects, Lactobacillus, isolation &amp; purification, Radiation Effects, Rats, Staphylococcus, isolation &amp; purification, Streptococcus, isolation &amp; purification
16039361<Studies of intestinal microflora. VII. Effect of diet and fecal microbial flora on survival of animals exposed to x irradiation.<Changes in the numbers and ratios of bacteria in the feces of rats were produced by administration of three different diets-grain, meat alone, and meat plus lactose. After significant alterations in the intestinal flora had developed, the animals were exposed to a midlethal dose of X irradiation (1,550 R). This treatment led to 100% deaths in rats in which the numbers of coliforms were increased by diet prior to irradiation. Changes in the numbers of lactobacilli appeared to play no role in determining the responses to X-ray exposure. When little or no change was produced by diet and when "normal" microflora was present, the fatality rate was reduced to 60%, and the rate of deaths was retarded when compared with that of the animals in which coliforms were increased.<Animals, Diet, Edible Grain, Enterobacteriaceae, isolation &amp; purification, Female, Intestines, Lactobacillus, isolation &amp; purification, Lactose, Meat, Radiation Injuries, Experimental, Rats
16039362<Basal organelles of bacterial flagella.<Liberated by enzymatic lysis of the cells, the flagella of Rhodospirillum rubrum, R. molischianum, and R. fulvum all have a similar structure. The hook at the base of the flagellum is connected by a short, narrow collar to a paired disc in the basal organelle. This paired disc is in turn connected to a second paired disc. The disposition of flagella to which fragments of the cell membrane still adhere suggests that the narrow collar at the base of the hook traverses both the wall and the membrane, and that the upper pair of discs in the basal organelle lies just beneath the surface of the membrane.<Bacteriolysis, Cell Membrane, Cell Wall, Flagella, Microscopy, Electron, Organoids, Rhodospirillum, cytology
16039363<Comparative study of the cell walls of the yeastlike and mycelial phases of Histoplasma capsulatum.<Cell walls were prepared from the yeastlike and mycelial phases (YP and MP) of Histoplasma capsulatum and from Saccharomyces cerevisiae by mechanical disruption and washing. Lipids were extracted with methanol-ether, chloroform, and acidified methanol:ether; a final extraction was made with ethylenediamine. The lipid contents of H. capsulatum YP and MP walls were about the same. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were made of the products obtained from treatment of the cell walls, or fractions from them, with weak acid or with enzymatic preparations containing glucanase and chitinase activities. YP walls contained much larger quantities of chitin and smaller quantities of mannose and amino acids than the MP walls. H. capsulatum MP was shown to resemble S. cerevisiae by low chitin content and by the presence of a mannose polymer, soluble in ethylenediamine and water. H. capsulatum MP chitin appeared to be intimately associated with glucose in the wall, since enzymatic hydrolysis of the residue after mild acid hydrolysis of cell walls or fractions from them resulted in the release of glucose and acetylglucosamine; only acetylglucosamine was released from YP walls with such treatment. By electron microscopic observations, the unextracted MP cell walls were much thinner than the YP, and neither wall appeared laminated.<Cell Wall, analysis, enzymology, Chitinases, metabolism, Glucose, analysis, Histoplasma, analysis, cytology, Lipids, analysis, Mannose, analysis, Microscopy, Electron, Saccharomyces, analysis, cytology
16039364<Membranes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.<A crude small particle pellet, obtained from postmitochondrial supernatant fractions of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, contains about half the ergosterol and phospholipid of crude cell homogenates. Most of the phospholipid of this pellet is in a "heavy" fraction which, with the aid of electron microscopy, shows membranous elements in addition to discrete particles. The "heavy" fraction, upon treatment with deoxycholate, can be freed of membranes, or, with ribonuclease treatment, ribosomes can be removed, leaving relatively clean membranes. The "heavy" fraction resembles the microsomes of animal cells, but contains considerably less lipids, including phospholipids, thus suggesting a less well-developed intracellular membrane system.<Carbon Isotopes, Choline, metabolism, Membranes, analysis, Phospholipids, analysis, Ribonucleases, metabolism, Ribosomes, metabolism, Saccharomyces, analysis, Ultracentrifugation
16039367<Intercellular communication and tissue growth. I. Cancerous growth.<Intercellular communication was examined with intracellular electrical techniques in primary and transplanted rat liver cancers. Normal liver cells communicate rather freely with each other through permeable junctional membranes. Cancer liver cells show no communication at all; their surface membrane is a strong barrier to diffusion all around the cell. Cancer cells induce alterations in membrane permeability in normal liver cells; communication among the latter is markedly reduced when cancer cells grow near them.<Animals, Biological Transport, Cell Membrane, physiology, Cell Membrane Permeability, Culture Techniques, Electrophysiology, instrumentation, Liver, physiology, Liver Neoplasms, physiopathology, Mathematics, Membrane Potentials, Neoplasms, Experimental, Rats
16039368<Intercellular communication and tissue growth. II. Tissue regeneration.<Intercellular communication was examined in regenerating rat liver and urodele skin, two tissues of fast but normal growth. In both, cellular communication is in general as good as in their respective normal intact state. This stands in striking contrast to the lack of cellular communication in tissues with cancerous growth. Upon wounding of the urodele skin, the normally permeable junctional membranes of cells near the wound border seal themselves off, thereby insulating the interiors of the communicated cell systems from the exterior. When the cells of two opposing borders make mechanical contact in the course of wound closure, communication between them ensues within 30 min. Within this period all cell movement also ceases ("contact inhibition"). The possible implications of these findings in the control of tissue growth are discussed.<Animals, Cell Division, Cell Membrane, physiology, Cell Membrane Permeability, Culture Techniques, Electrophysiology, instrumentation, Liver Regeneration, physiology, Rats, Regeneration, physiology, Skin Physiological Phenomena, Urodela, Wound Healing
16039369<Particle arrangements in proplastids of Triticum vulgare L. seedlings.<Particles having ribosome-like characteristics are described in proplastids of dark-grown wheat seedlings as the membranes of the prolamellar body become transformed, under the influence of light, into grana and fret membranes. Three arrangements of particles were noted: (1) a random distribution of discrete particles; (2) particles occurring in helices or parallel rows; and (3) particles arranged in rough squares with six to eight particles per side. It is possible that the third type of particle is a cross-section of long parallel rods. A particle ranges in size from 170 to 220 A, those of group three being somewhat smaller. The particulates vary from diamond shaped with smooth surfaces to circular with irregular surfaces. These particles have the characteristics of ribosomes as visualized by the electron microscope: they are preserved by glutaraldehyde and osmium tetroxide, they stain intensely with uranyl acetate, and are digested by RNase. Their properties do not coincide with those of viruses, smog-induced particles, stromacenter particles, or phytoferritin. They are frequently adjacent to membranes but never attached to membranes. The involvement of ribosomes in membrane development is discussed.<Cell Membrane, Microscopy, Electron, Organoids, Plant Cells, RNA, analysis, Ribosomes, metabolism
16039370<Synthesis of RNA in mammalian cells during mitosis and interphase.<Chinese hamster cells in the mitotic and G(1) phases of the growth cycle were incubated for 30 or 60 min in suspension tissue culture and pulse-labeled with tritiated uridine. After appropriate chases, washes, and extractions, it was found that all incorporation into the nucleic acid may be accounted for by those cells in interphase. An average of 410 counts was found for incorporation into the cell population (approximately 2.0 x 10(5) cells) of which over 80% of the cells was initially in mitosis. The increasing number of cells leaving mitosis and entering interphase during the 30 min incubation was theoretically able to account for 470 counts. In addition, short-pulse labeling experiments have shown a consistent linear relationship between the percentage of cells in division and the incorporation of the isotope, which strongly suggests that, if 100% of the cells were in mitosis, the counts would be essentially zero. Thus, the entire label may be attributed to those cells in interphase where portions of the chromosomal material are known to be already extended.<Animals, Cell Division, Cricetinae, Culture Techniques, Mathematics, RNA, biosynthesis, Tritium, Uridine, metabolism
16039371<Nucleolar and nuclear RNA synthesis during the cell life cycle in monkey and pig kidney cells in vitro.<The incorporation of 5-(3)H-uridine and 5-(3)H-cytidine into nucleolar and nonnucleolar RNA in the nucleus of monkey and pig kidney cells was measured in vitro during the cell life cycle. Time-lapse cinematographic records were made of cells during asynchronous exponential proliferation, in order to identify the temporal position of individual cells in relation to the preceding mitosis. Immediately following cinematography, cells were labeled with uridine-(3)H and cytidine-(3)H for a short period, fixed, and analyzed by radioautography. Since the data permit correlation of the rate of RNA labeling with the position of a cell within the cycle, curves could be constructed describing the rate of RNA synthesis over the average cell cycle. RNA synthesis was absent in early telophase, and rose very abruptly in rate in late telophase and in very early G(1) in both the nucleus and the reconstituting nucleolus. Thereafter, through the G(1) and S periods the rate of nuclear RNA synthesis rose gradually. When we used a 10-min pulse, there was no detectable change in the rate for nucleolar RNA labeling in monkey kidney cells during G(1) or S. When we used a 30-min labeling time, the rate of nucleolar RNA labeling rose gradually in pig kidney cells. With increasing time after mitosis, the data became more variable, which may, in part, be related to the variation in generation times for individual cells.<Animals, Autoradiography, Cell Division, Cell Nucleolus, metabolism, Cell Nucleus, metabolism, In Vitro Techniques, Kidney, metabolism, Nucleosides, metabolism, RNA, biosynthesis, Tritium, Uridine, metabolism
16039372<Micronuclear RNA synthesis in Paramecium caudatum.<In a generation time of 8 hr in Paramecium caudatum, the bulk of DNA synthesis detected by thymidine-(3)H incorporation takes place in the latter part of the cell cycle. The micronuclear cycle includes a G(1) of 3 hr followed by an S period of 3-3(1/2) hr. G(2) and division occupies the remaining period of the cycle. Macronuclear RNA synthesis detected by 5'-uridine-(3)H incorporation is continuous throughout the cell cycle. Micronuclear RNA synthesis is restricted to the S period. Ribonuclease removes 80-90% of the incorporated label. Pulse-chase experiments showed that part of the RNA is conserved and released to the cytoplasm during the succeeding G(1) period.<Animals, Autoradiography, Cell Division, Cell Nucleus, metabolism, DNA, biosynthesis, Paramecium, metabolism, RNA, biosynthesis, Ribonucleases, metabolism, Thymidine, metabolism, Tritium, Uridine, metabolism

Sensitivities to (3)H and (35)S radiation, i.e. ratio of developed grains to radioactive decays in the specimen, were determined with Ilford L4 and Kodak NTE emulsions. The highest values obtained in monolayers of emulsion were (1/8) for (3)H and 1/21 for (35)S.

16039373<Reversible degradation of polyribosomes in Chang cells cultured in a glutamine-deficient medium.<The effects of temporary glutamine deficiency on the protein and nucleic acid metabolism of Chang's liver cells in suspension cultures have been studied. It was observed that cells maintained in a glutamine-free medium showed a reduced incorporation of labeled precursors into protein and RNA. At the same time, the activity of the ribosomes and the proportion of polyribosomal aggregates in cell extracts diminished. These effects were reversed when the glutamine content of the medium was restored. The restoration of a normal rate of amino acid incorporation by intact cells as well as by cell-free systems was time dependent, and took place within a few hours after glutamine addition without preceding increase in the prevailing low rate of RNA synthesis. The addition of actinomycin D at concentrations that strongly inhibited the RNA metabolism of the cells did not prevent the increase in protein synthesis or the reappearance of polyribosomal aggregates. These facts suggest that the restoration of protein synthesis in the cells after glutamine starvation was not dependent on a production of new messenger RNA. The experimental data are consistent with the hypothesis that previously synthesized messenger RNA, preserved in the cells in a stable form, was brought into action in response to the reestablishment of an adequate cellular environment.<Amino Acids, metabolism, Animals, Carbon Isotopes, Centrifugation, Density Gradient, Culture Media, Culture Techniques, Dactinomycin, pharmacology, Glutamine, pharmacology, Leucine, metabolism, Liver, metabolism, Phenylalanine, metabolism, RNA, biosynthesis, RNA, Messenger, biosynthesis, Ribosomes, metabolism, Uridine, metabolism
16039375<Lipid synthesis, intracellular transport, storage, and secretion. I. Electron microscopic radioautographic study of liver after injection of tritiated palmitate or glycerol in fasted and ethanol-treated rats.<A time sequence study of intracellular movement of labeled lipid in the liver was carried out on fasted and ethanol-treated rats injected with either palmitate-(3)H or glycerol-(3)H by electron microscopic radioautography. The elimination of water-soluble lipid precursors during specimen preparation was checked and found to be complete. The labeled lipid product in the tissue was identified as mostly triglyceride. A dehydration procedure was adapted to minimize the loss of lipid during specimen preparation. At 2 min after injection, the earliest time interval studied, both precursors were found to have penetrated the liver cells, and the label was found over both rough and smooth elements of the endoplasmic reticulum, which is the site of glyceride esterification. From 5 min on, in fasted and especially in ethanol-treated rats, the label was seen also over lipid droplets 0.5-2.0 micro in diameter, which represent "storage lipid" (slowly turning over compartment). Mitochondria became labeled mostly at later time intervals after injection. From 10 min on, concentration of label was seen over the Golgi apparatus, containing small osmiophilic particles. Association of label with groups of particles in smooth-surfaced vesicles and vacuoles in and near the Golgi apparatus and in the vicinity of the sinusoidal border was seen, both after palmitate-(3)H and glycerol-(3)H. It is proposed that these particles represent lipoproteins which are formed in the endoplasmic reticulum, "processed" in the Golgi apparatus, and transported in vacuoles to the sinusoid surface to be discharged into the circulation.<Adipose Tissue, analysis, Animals, Autoradiography, Biological Transport, Choline, metabolism, Endoplasmic Reticulum, metabolism, Ethanol, pharmacology, Fasting, Fatty Acids, blood, Female, Glycerides, analysis, Glycerol, metabolism, Golgi Apparatus, metabolism, Intestines, analysis, Lipid Metabolism, Lipoproteins, biosynthesis, Liver, drug effects, metabolism, Microscopy, Electron, Mitochondria, metabolism, Palmitic Acids, metabolism, Phospholipids, metabolism, Rats, Triglycerides, analysis, Tritium
16039376<Constancy of DNA content in adrenal medulla nuclei of cold-treated rats.<Reports of changes in DNA content of certain types of cells following exposure to conditions of stress has led to the suggestion that two kinds of DNA may be present. One is genetic DNA, and the other is called "metabolic" DNA. In a further attempt to investigate the possibility of this phenomenon, determinations of DNA content were made on Feulgen-stained nuclei of adrenal glands and kidneys in cold-treated rats. Feulgen-stained nuclei were measured by two-wavelength microspectrophotometry. Particular attention was given to the handling of the smears in hydrolysis and staining. Mean values of Feulgen-DNA contents in a total of 720 nuclei demonstrated (a) a constancy of DNA content within 2% in individual nuclei both in adrenal medulla and kidney cortex, (b) no more than an average of 2% difference in DNA content between control and experimental nuclei, and (c) no more than an average of 1.5% difference in DNA content between normal kidney cortex nuclei and normal adrenal medulla nuclei. These results confirm the view that the more precise the measurement, the more accurately the constancy rule is obeyed. Moreover, there is no support for the concept of a metabolic DNA in the rat adrenal medulla.<Adrenal Medulla, analysis, Animals, Cell Nucleus, analysis, Cold Temperature, Cytogenetics, DNA, analysis, Histocytochemistry, Male, Rats, Spectrophotometry, Stress, Physiological
16039377<Cell junctions in ommatidia of Limulus.<The intercellular relationships in the ommatidia of the lateral eye of Limulus have been investigated. The distal process of the eccentric cell gives origin to microvilli which interdigitate with the microvilli of the retinular cells. Therefore, both types of visual cells contribute to form the rhabdom and may have an analogous photoreceptor function. Quintuple-layered junctions are found within the rhabdom at the lines of demarcation between adjoining microvilli, whether the microvilli originate from a single retinular cell, from two adjacent retinular cells, or from a retinular cell and the eccentric cell. Furthermore, quintuple-layered junctions between the eccentric cell and the tips of the microvilli of the retinular cells occur at the boundary between the distal process and the rhabdom. These findings are interpreted to indicate that the rhabdom provides an extensive electrotonic junction relating retinular cells to one another and to the eccentric cell. Quintuple-layered junctions between glial and visual cells, as well as other structural features of the ommatidial cells, are also described.<Animals, Cell Membrane, Crustacea, cytology, Endoplasmic Reticulum, Extracellular Space, Eye, cytology, Microscopy, Electron, Mitochondria, Sensory Receptor Cells
16039378<Electron microscopic and biochemical characterization of collagen in blattarian insects.<The occurrence of collagen in the cockroach Leucophaea maderae has been demonstrated by electron optical and biochemical techniques. Electron micrographs of tissues of this and a related species (Blaberus craniifer) are presented and they show that collagenous-type fibers occur in the stroma of nonneural as well as neural organs of these insects. Hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine, amino acids considered to be "markers" for collagen, have been shown to be present in proteins extracted from material rich in neuroglandular tissue (corpus cardiacum plus corpus allatum). Trimmed carcasses of Leucophaea maderae have been shown to contain a protein or proteins soluble in hot trichloroacetic acid, with compositional characteristics similar to those of collagens in general, including diagnostic proportions of glycine, proline, hydroxyproline, and hydroxylysine. This collagen is not soluble in dilute acetic acid or in concentrated solutions of guanidinium chloride.

16039379<Action of Triton X-100 on chloroplast membranes. Mechanisms of structural and functional disruption.<Addition of Triton X-100 to chloroplast suspensions to a final concentration of 100-200 microM causes an approximate tripling of chloroplast volume and complete inhibition of light-induced conformational changes, light-dependent hydrogen ion transport, and photophosphorylation. Electron microscopic studies show that chloroplasts treated in this manner manifest extensive swelling in the form of vesicles within their inner membrane structure. Triton was adsorbed to chloroplast membranes in a manner suggesting a partition between the membrane phase and the suspending medium, rather than a strong, irreversible binding. This adsorption results in the production of pores through which ions may freely pass, and it is suggested that the inhibition of conformational changes, hydrogen ion transport, and photophosphorylation by Triton is due to an inability of treated chloroplast membranes to maintain a light-dependent pH gradient. The observed swelling is due to water influx in response to a fixed, osmotically active species within the chloroplasts, after ionic equilibrium has occurred. This is supported by the fact that chloroplasts will shrink upon Triton addition if a nonpenetrating, osmotically active material such as dextran or polyvinylpyrrolidone is present externally in sufficient concentration (&gt;0.1 mM) to offset the osmotic activity of the internal species.<Adsorption, Biological Transport, Chloroplasts, drug effects, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Membranes, drug effects, Microscopy, Electron, Osmosis, Oxidative Phosphorylation, Surface-Active Agents, pharmacology
16039901<Interactions of aflatoxin with histones and DNA.<The interactions of aflatoxin B(1) with certain histone fractions and DNA were investigated by means of viscosity measurements and equilibrium dialysis. Two main histone fractions (F2b and F1), both lysine-rich, were examined after treatment with the toxin. Fraction 2b and 1 differ in amino acid composition and behave differently, in regard to gross conformation, in the presence of electrolytes. Aflatoxin increased the viscosity of fraction 2b but affected the viscosity of fraction 1 only slightly. Equilibrium dialysis experiments showed that aflatoxin was bound to both histone fractions. Aflatoxin also increased the viscosity of DNA and equilibrium dialysis showed that 1 molecule of the toxin was bound to approximately every 5 nucleotides of the nucleic acid. Binding constants for the aflatoxin complexes were calculated as 1000 for F2b, 700 for F1, and 5500 for DNA. The biological implications of these data, in regard to the effect aflatoxin has on the information-transcription process, are discussed.<Aflatoxins, pharmacology, Animals, Cattle, DNA, biosynthesis, Histones, pharmacology, In Vitro Techniques, Protein Binding, Thymus Gland, cytology, Viscosity
16040018<Alterations in microsomal electron transport, oxidative N-demethylation and azo-dye cleavage in carbon tetrachloride and dimethylnitrosamine-induced liver injury.<The effect of administration of carbon tetrachloride and dimethylnitrosamine in vivo on hepatic microsomal function related to drug metabolism was measured. It was found that the capacity of isolated microsomes to demethylate dimethylaniline was diminished during the first hour after carbon tetrachloride poisoning and during the second hour after dimethylnitrosamine poisoning. Thereafter the microsomes from carbon tetrachloride-poisoned livers showed a continuous decline in activity so that at 24hr. there was little residual capacity to undertake demethylation. Microsomes from dimethylnitrosamine-poisoned animals were not different from controls at 24hr. During the first 3hr. there was a transient rise in the accumulation of the N-oxide intermediate in carbon tetrachloride-poisoned livers, with a subsequent fall to below control values. In dimethylnitrosamine poisoning there was a parallel decrease in N-oxide accumulation with decreased demethylation. In the latter part of the first 24hr. the ratio of N-oxide accumulation to demethylation was increased in both instances. At 2hr. after poisoning with either compound there was no evidence of altered NADPH(2)-dependent neotetrazolium reduction or lipid peroxidation. NADPH(2)-dependent azo-dye cleavage was decreased. There was no difference in microsomal cytochrome b(5) content, but there was a decrease in the amount of cytochrome P-450. This latter change was correlated with the decreased capacity for NADPH(2)-dependent oxidative demethylation. It is suggested that dimethylnitrosamine is associated with a defect in microsomal NADPH(2)-dependent electron transport at the level of cytochrome P-450. In addition to affecting cytochrome P-450, carbon tetrachloride is associated with a second severe block involving the release of formaldehyde from the N-oxide intermediate.<Alkylation, Animals, Azo Compounds, metabolism, Carbon Tetrachloride Poisoning, metabolism, Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury, metabolism, Cytochromes, analysis, Electron Transport, Liver, enzymology, Male, Microsomes, metabolism, Nitrosamines, poisoning, Oxidoreductases, analysis, Rats
16040152<Fixed charge in the cell membrane.<1. Focal electric field was generated by passing a current of 5 x 10(-7) to 1 x 10(-5) A from a micropipette into the culture medium. Movement of cells at a distance of 5-50 mu from the electrode tip was observed. In case of cells embedded in the culture only local deformation of the membrane was observed.2. The cell species explored included neurones, glia, muscle fibres, connective cells, malignant cells and erythrocytes. All cells responded in a similar manner to the electric field, and the current required was in the same range.3. Cells were attracted to a positive micropipette and repelled from a negative one: the only exception was observed in certain malignant cells which moved in the opposite direction.4. Movement and membrane deformation could be obtained with electrodes filled with various concentrated and isotonic solutions. The composition of the culture medium also had no qualitative influence on these effects.5. Metabolic poisons or rupture of the cell membrane had no effect on the movement. Isolated membrane fragments showed movement similar to that of intact cells.6. The possibility of artifacts due to proximity of the focal electrode is considered. It is shown that electro-osmosis cannot account for the present observations. Some other artifacts are also excluded.7. It is proposed that the most satisfactory way to account for the present observations is by a membrane carrying negative fixed charge of the order of 2.5 x 10(3) e.s.u./cm(2). Some physiological consequences of presence of negative charge in the membrane are briefly discussed.<Animals, Cell Membrane, physiology, Connective Tissue, physiology, Connective Tissue Cells, Culture Techniques, Electrophoresis, Electrophysiology, Erythrocytes, physiology, Ganglia, physiology, Myofibrils, physiology, Neurons, physiology, Poultry, Rats
16040153<The effects of haemorrhage in the unanaesthetized rabbit.<1. The circulatory response following acute loss of 26% of the blood volume was examined in unanaesthetized rabbits. The groups of animals studied were normal rabbits; adrenalectomized rabbits; animals subjected to prolonged treatment with guanethidine in which peripheral adrenergic nerve transmission is blocked, but which can reflexly liberate adrenal medullary hormones; animals subjected to combined adrenalectomy and guanethidine treatment with no functional adrenergic effectors; in each case with or without administration of atropine. The responses of animals with section of the carotid sinus and aortic nerves were also examined.2. The spontaneous rate of replacement of the blood volume after haemorrhage by reabsorption of extravascular fluid was the same in all the above preparations, the blood volume returning to normal 3-4 hr after bleeding.3. The ;passive' effects of haemorrhage were examined in animals without functioning autonomic effectors and include a large fall in right atrial pressure and cardiac output, arterial hypotension, no significant change in total peripheral resistance, and a bradycardia of gradual onset. Reflex autonomic effector activity in normal animals minimizes the fall in atrial pressure, cardiac output and arterial blood pressure, and produces a significant increase in total peripheral resistance and tachycardia. Increased sympathetic nerve activity and secretion of adrenal medullary hormones each play an important and complementary part in the normal circulatory response to haemorrhage of the rabbit. There is also reflex reduction in vagal efferent activity.4. Reflexes from the carotid sinus and aortic arch limit the fall in arterial pressure for the first 4 hr after haemorrhage. These reflexes also account for the tachycardia normally observed after haemorrhage. The baroreceptor reflexes rather than the chemoreceptors appear to be dominant in these responses.5. Twenty-four hours after haemorrhage the haemodynamic pattern is similar in all preparations irrespective of their autonomic effector status: blood volume, right atrial pressures and cardiac outputs are all elevated, and the arterial pressure has virtually recovered, consistent with the development of hypervolaemic anaemia at this time.<Adrenal Glands, physiology, Adrenal Medulla, physiology, Adrenalectomy, Animals, Autonomic Nervous System, physiology, Blood Circulation, physiology, Blood Volume, Cardiac Output, Carotid Sinus, physiology, Guanethidine, pharmacology, Heart Rate, Hemorrhage, physiopathology, Parasympathetic Nervous System, physiology, Pressoreceptors, physiology, Rabbits, Reflex, Respiration, physiology, Sympathetic Nervous System, physiology

The effect of changes in the pH of the extracellular solution on the membrane conductance of frog sartorius and toe muscle fibres was measured with intracellular micro-electrodes.2. In Ringer solution the membrane conductance was found to be highly sensitive to changes in pH between 5.0 and 9.8. In alkaline solution the conductance rose; in acid solution it fell.3. After replacement of chloride by the relatively impermeant methylsulphate ion the membrane conductance showed little change when pH was altered. It is concluded that chloride is the ion species principally concerned in the pH sensitivity of the resting membrane conductance.4. The relation between pH and the chloride conductance was sigmoid, with the steepest part of the curve lying in the region of neutrality.5. The membrane conductance of muscles equilibrated in a 100 mM-K 216 mM-Cl solution was also sensitive to changes of extracellular pH. As in Ringer solution, the membrane conductance rose in alkaline and fell in acid solutions in a sigmoid fashion.6. Sartorius muscles in isotonic potassium methylsulphate solution showed no change in membrane conductance at different pH values.7. In chloride-free solution a fall in pH tended to cause depolarization; a rise in pH had the opposite effect.8. In Ringer solution the initial effect of a rise in pH was usually a transient depolarization. The indication is that the intracellular concentration of chloride ions may be slightly in excess of that which corresponds to the resting potential. The long-term effects of changes in pH on the membrane potential in Ringer solution were in the same direction as in the absence of chloride.9. The transient potential changes produced on addition and withdrawal of chloride ions were found to be larger in alkaline solutions than in acid solutions. This is further evidence for a higher chloride permeability in alkaline solutions.<Animals, Anura, Biological Transport, Calcium, pharmacology, Chlorides, pharmacology, Electrophysiology, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, In Vitro Techniques, Membrane Potentials, physiology, Membranes, physiology, Muscles, drug effects, physiology
16040155<The effect of pH on the 36-Cl efflux from frog skeletal muscle.<1. Frog sartorii and toe muscles were loaded in a 100 mM-K 216 mM-Cl solution at pH 7.4 labelled with either (36)Cl, or (42)K, or with both isotopes. The efflux of the isotopes into inactive solution of the same composition at pH 5.0 and 9.8 was followed.2. The efflux of (36)Cl into acid solution was extremely slow so that the cellular fraction could easily be distinguished. On raising the pH the efflux of (36)Cl from sartorii increased 4.5 +/- 0.43 (mean +/- S.E.) times; from toe muscles 6.7 +/- 0.69 (mean +/- S.E.) times. The effect was fully reversible.3. The efflux of (42)K from sartorii was only slightly increased by alkaline solutions. When the effluxes of (36)Cl and (42)K were measured simultaneously the increment in chloride efflux was much greater than the increment in (42)K efflux.4. Toe muscles depolarized by high potassium solution showed an approximately twofold increase in (42)K efflux on transfer from acid to alkaline solution. This effect was independent of the presence of chloride ions.5. The results confirm the identification of chloride as the ion species principally concerned in the pH sensitivity of the membrane conductance.<Animals, Anura, Biological Transport, Chlorides, analysis, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, In Vitro Techniques, Membranes, physiology, Muscles, analysis, Potassium, analysis, Radioisotopes, Radiometry
16040156<Action of some foreign cations and anions on the chloride permeability of frog muscle.<1. Evidence for the existence in skeletal muscle of a specific cation binding system capable of lowering the chloride permeability was obtained by testing the effect of several metal ion species upon the efflux of (36)Cl from frog muscles equilibrated in high-KCl solution.2. Cu(2+), Zn(2+) and UO(2) (2+) ions, when present in concentrations of approximately 10(-4)M in inactive wash solution at pH 7.4 slowed the efflux of (36)Cl to half its original value. At pH 5.0, when the chloride permeability was already low as a consequence of hydrogen ion binding, these metal ions had little further effect.3. Presence of Ni(2+), Co(2+), Pb(2+), Ce(3+) and La(3+) in 10(-4)M or higher concentrations had no detectable influence on the (36)Cl efflux. Wide variations in Ca(2+) concentration were similarly ineffective.4. The influence of more adsorbable anions on the chloride permeability was examined at different pH values. Extracellular iodide greatly slowed the rapid efflux of (36)Cl into alkaline solution. In acid solutions, when the chloride permeability was already low, the effect of iodide was less pronounced, but still demonstrable. The chloride permeability was consequently increased to a lesser extent by a rise in pH in the presence of iodide.5. The efflux of iodide and bromide was measured at different pH values under conditions of self exchange. In alkaline solution the permeabilities to iodide and bromide were considerably lower than that to chloride. In acid solution the membrane differentiated less between anion species of different adsorbability.<Animals, Anura, Biological Transport, Bromides, pharmacology, Chlorides, analysis, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, In Vitro Techniques, Iodides, pharmacology, Ions, pharmacology, Metals, pharmacology, Muscles, drug effects, Radioisotopes
16040157<The production of persistent changes in the level of neuronal activity by brief local cooling of the cerebral cortex of the rat.<1. Local cooling of the surface of the cerebral cortex of the rat gives rise to an increase in the spontaneous firing rate of cortical neurones.2. When this increase in firing is maintained, by continued cooling, for 5 min or more, a prolonged after-effect consisting of an increase in rate above the control level is produced lasting up to at least 3(1/2) hr following restoration of temperature.3. The potential gradient across the cortical surface during cooling is in the opposite direction to that required to produce an increase in firing during and after trans-cortical polarization.4. It is therefore likely that the important factor in producing after-effects is associated with the actual firing rate of the neurones during the cooling (or polarizing) procedure rather than the accompanying extracellular potential gradient.<Action Potentials, physiology, Animals, Cerebral Cortex, physiology, Cold Temperature, Electrophysiology, Neural Conduction, physiology, Neurons, physiology, Rats
16040159<The nature of rise in threshold produced by contrast-flashes.<1. The rod threshold for seeing a flash on a 2(1/2) degrees square is raised by a nearly simultaneous flash that falls on the surround. When this ;contrast-flash' is held fixed in intensity, it raises the log test threshold by a fixed amount no matter how far that threshold has already been raised by light adaptation owing to background or bleaching.2. This is surprising since fixed backgrounds and bleachings raise the log test threshold much more when the eye is dark than when light adapted.3. When the test flash is held at some fixed supra-threshold value, the contrast flash exhibits a ;critical level', above which the test will no longer be seen. If the surround region upon which the contrast-flash falls is adapted by background or bleaching, its efficacy is reduced so that the ;critical level' is raised.4. Surround adaptation raises the log ;critical level' by the same amount that it raises the log threshold for seeing the contrast-flash itself.5. The way that contrast flashes raise the test threshold is thus entirely different from the way that adaptations by bleachings or backgrounds do. Contrast-flash signals appear to inhibit test-flash signals by interaction at some point central to the site where adaptation occurs.6. This permits the effect of adaptation on signals to be measured. A given state of adaptation attenuates all flash signals in the same proportion. And in any state of adaptation a single flash will reach threshold when the attenuated signal has a fixed size.<Accommodation, Ocular, physiology, Optics and Photonics, Photoreceptor Cells, physiology, Retina, physiology, Vision, Ocular, physiology
16040160<The timing of calcium action during neuromuscular transmission.<1. When a nerve-muscle preparation is paralysed by tetrodotoxin, brief depolarizing pulses applied to a motor nerve ending cause packets of acetylcholine to be released and evoke end-plate potentials (e.p.p.s), provided calcium ions are present in the extracellular fluid.2. By ionophoretic discharge from a 1 M-CaCl(2) pipette, it is possible to produce a sudden increase in the local calcium concentration at the myoneural junction, at varying times before or after the depolarizing pulse.3. A brief application of calcium facilitates transmitter release if it occurs immediately before the depolarizing pulse. If the calcium pulse is applied a little later, during the period of the synaptic delay, it is ineffective.4. It is concluded that the utilization of external calcium ions at the neuromuscular junction is restricted to a brief period which barely outlasts the depolarization of the nerve ending, and which precedes the transmitter release itself.5. The suppressing effect of magnesium on transmitter release was studied by a similar method, with ionophoretic discharges from a 1 M-MgCl(2)-filled pipette. The results, though not quite as clear as with calcium, indicate that Mg pulses also are only effective if they precede the depolarizing pulses.<Animals, Anura, Calcium, pharmacology, In Vitro Techniques, Iontophoresis, Muscle Contraction, drug effects, Neural Conduction, drug effects, Neuromuscular Junction, drug effects, Synapses, drug effects, Tetrodotoxin, pharmacology, Toxins, Biological, pharmacology
16040158<Monoamines and their metabolites in the avian brain.<1. In the avian brain, a high concentration of dopamine was found in a sharply contoured region of the nucleus basalis which may or may not have included the nucleus entopeduncularis, and therefore lay within the palaeostriatum of the nomenclature of Crosby and Huber. This was thus the only region which may be considered biochemically homologous to the mammalian corpus striatum. For purposes of macroscopic identification only, the region is described here as the ;anterior part of the nucleus basalis'. The concentration of dopamine was 3 mug/g in the pigeon, about the same in the duck and chicken, and 7.5 mug/g in the finch. In the pigeon this region also contained some noradrenaline; the quantity of 5-hydroxytryptamine (1.4 mug/g) and 5-hydroxyindolylacetic acid (0.6 mug/g) was larger than in any other part of the brain.2. In the brain of the pigeon and the chicken, the highest concentrations of noradrenaline (1.5 and 1.4 mug/g) were found in the hypothalamus.3. The concentration of adrenaline was higher in the avian than in the mammalian brain. In the hypothalamus, it ranged from 0.4 mug/g in the pigeon to 1 mug/g in the chicken.4. Fluorescence microscopy, using the formaldehyde condensation method, showed, in the anterior part of the nucleus basalis, a large area of diffuse green-yellow fluorescence, similar in appearance to the fluorescence of the striatum of the rat. In addition this part of the brain contained a small region of fluorescent fibres and varicosities. It is suggested that the diffuse fluorescence was produced by dopamine. It was absent from brains of reserpine-treated pigeons.5. In the pigeon, reserpine, tetrabenazine and prenylamine produced a decrease in the concentration of brain monoamines, an effect which was comparable to that seen in mammals. Yet, none of these drugs raised the concentration of homovanillic acid, but they increased that of 5-hydroxyindolylacetic acid; these drugs raise the concentration of both acids in mammalian brain.6. In the pigeon beta-tetrahydronaphthylamine decreased the concentration of all monoamines and their metabolites, an action quite different from that produced in the mammalian brain.7. The main effect of morphine and of M 99 (6,14-endoetheno-7-(2-hydroxy-2-pentyl)-tetrahydro-oripavine hydrochloride) was a lowering of the noradrenaline concentration.8. As in mammals, chlorpromazine affected only the dopamine metabolism.9. In the guinea-pig and the pigeon, the administration of alpha-methyl-DOPA led to a substitution of much of the cerebral noradrenaline by alpha-methyl-noradrenaline, sometimes in excess of the lost noradrenaline. However, although the loss of dopamine was severe in both pigeon and guinea-pig, only little alpha-methyl-dopamine accumulated in the pigeon brain, so that it did not consitute a replacement for the lost dopamine; in the guinea-pig, alpha-methyl-dopamine was found in quantities similar to, or exceeding those, of the lost dopamine.<Amines, analysis, Animals, Biological Assay, Birds, Brain, drug effects, metabolism, Brain Chemistry, Dihydroxyphenylalanine, pharmacology, Dopamine, analysis, metabolism, Epinephrine, metabolism, Guinea Pigs, Hydroxyindoleacetic Acid, analysis, Microscopy, Fluorescence, Norepinephrine, metabolism, Rats, Serotonin, Tranquilizing Agents, pharmacology
16040161<Fusimotor stimulation and the dynamic sensitivity of the secondary ending of the muscle spindle.<The response of secondary endings of de-efferented muscle spindles in the soleus muscle of the anaesthetized cat was recorded during stretching of the muscle at velocities of 5-30 mm/sec. Stimulation of single fusimotor fibres, most and probably all of which were static fusimotor fibres, produced no appreciable change in the normally small dynamic sensitivity of these endings.<Animals, Cats, Electric Stimulation, Muscle Contraction, physiology, Myofibrils, physiology, Nerve Endings, physiology, Neural Conduction, physiology, Neurons, physiology
16040360<Application of the single-dose assay technique to psittacosis.<When suspensions of psittacosis organisms were injected intracerebrally into groups of mice, a nearly linear relationship was observed between the concentration of the organisms injected and the mean time to death of the mice. Thirty-four psittacosis preparations were assayed and, by plotting the relationship between the reciprocal time to death for mice given the 10(-3) dilution of agent against the number of mouse intracerebral median lethal doses (MICLD(50)), a reference curve was established. By use of this reference curve, it was possible to estimate directly the LD(50) value of a psittacosis suspension of unknown concentration from the mean reciprocal time to death of a group of mice injected with a single dilution. By this procedure, the number of mice used was reduced by 62.5%, the titrations were completed in 3 to 5 days as compared with the usual 12 days, three to four times as many assays could be done in 1 day, and no assays had to be repeated. In addition, the precision of the single-dilution assay compared favorably with that of the LD(50) titration.<Animals, Biological Assay, Chick Embryo, Chlamydia, isolation &amp; purification, Mice, Psittacosis
16040534<Obliquely striated muscle. 3. Contraction mechanism of Ascaris body muscle.<Segments of the obliquely striated body muscle of Ascaris were fixed at minimum body length after treatment with acetylcholine and at maximum body length after treatment with piperazine citrate and then studied by light and electron microscopy. Evidence was found for two mechanisms of length change: sliding of thin filaments with respect to thick filaments such as occurs in cross-striated muscle, and shearing of thick filaments with respect to each other such that the degree of their stagger increases with extension and decreases with shortening. The shearing mechanism could account for great extensibility in this muscle and in nonstriated muscles in general and could underlie other manifestations of "plasticity" as well. In addition, it is suggested that the contractile apparatus is attached to the endomysium in such a way that the sarcomeres can act either in series, as in cross-striated muscle, or individually. Since the sarcomeres are virtually longitudinal in orientation and are almost coextensive with the muscle fiber, it would, therefore, be possible for a single sarcomere contracting independently to develop tension effectively between widely separated points on the fiber surface, thus permitting very efficient maintenance of isometric tension.<Acetylcholine, pharmacology, Animals, Ascaris, physiology, Connective Tissue Cells, Microscopy, Microscopy, Electron, Muscle Contraction, drug effects, physiology, Muscles, cytology, Piperazines, pharmacology
16040535<Isolated nerve endings (neurosecretosomes) from the posterior pituitary. Partial separation of vasopressin and oxytocin and the isolation of microvesicles.<Subcellular fractions of the bovine posterior pituitary, including one composed almost exclusively of pinched-off nerve endings (neurosecretosomes), were characterized electron microscopically, hormonally, and enzymically. 15% of the nerve terminals in the gland were isolated as neurosecretosomes, as estimated from determinations of lactic dehydrogenase, a soluble, cytoplasmic enzyme. Neurosecretosomes were subdivided into three fractions by density-gradient centrifugation. The three subfractions, each shown to be nearly homogeneous populations of neurosecretosomes by means of electron microscopic and enzymic criteria, differed from each other in their vasopressin/oxytocin (VP/OT) ratios. The VP/OT ratio increased from the lightest to the densest fraction, indicating that VP is localized to denser and OT to lighter neurosecretosomes; similar results have been obtained previously for subfractions of neurosecretory granules (NSG). No morphological differences were apparent in neurosecretosomes among the three subfractions. Although complete separation of VP and OT was not achieved, the findings suggest that VP and OT are each stored in a different species of nerve ending and support the hypothesis that a given neurosecretory cell synthesizes, stores, and secretes only one of the peptide hormones. Microvesicles, 40-80 mmicro diameter and contained in typical neurosecretory cell terminals, are believed to be degradation products of membrane ghosts of depleted NSG; electron micrographs indicative of this transformation are presented. A fraction rich in microvesicles, but containing some NSG membranes, was prepared by density-gradient centrifugation of an osmolysate of neurosecretosomes. Smaller, apparently nonneurosecretory nerve endings, lacking NSG but filled with small vesicles, are occasionally seen in sections from whole gland. The vesicles in these atypical posterior pituitary nerve endings may be true neurohumor-containing, "synaptic" vesicles.<Animals, Cattle, Centrifugation, Density Gradient, Histocytochemistry, L-Lactate Dehydrogenase, metabolism, Lysosomes, enzymology, Microscopy, Electron, Mitochondria, Nerve Endings, metabolism, Neurosecretion, Nitrogen, metabolism, Oxytocin, metabolism, Pituitary Gland, Posterior, cytology, innervation, Succinate Dehydrogenase, metabolism, Vasopressins, metabolism
16040537<Electron microscopy of mitosis in amebae. 3. Cold and urea treatments: a basis for tests of direct effects of mitotic inhibitors on microtubule formation.<The mitotic apparatus (MA) of the giant ameba, Chaos carolinensis, has characteristic sequences of microtubule arrays and deployment of nuclear envelope fragments. If mitotic organisms are subjected to 2 degrees C for 5 min, the MA microtubules are completely degraded, and the envelope fragments are released from the chromosomes which remain condensed but lose their metaphase-plate orientation. On warming, microtubules reform but show partial loss of their parallel alignment; displacement of the envelope fragments persists or is increased by microtubule reformation. This study demonstrates that cooling causes destruction of microtubules and intermicrotubular cross-bonds and further shows that such controlled dissolution and reformation can provide an in vivo test sequence for studies on the effects of inhibitor-compounds on microtubule subunit aggregation. Urea, at the comparatively low concentration of 0.8 M, inhibited reformation following cooling and rewarming but was ineffective in altering microtubules that had formed before treatment.<Amoeba, physiology, Animals, Cell Division, physiology, Cell Nucleus, drug effects, Chromosomes, Cold Temperature, Microscopy, Electron, Organoids, growth &amp; development, Urea, pharmacology
16040538<The loss of kinetoplastic DNA in two species of Trypanosomatidae treated with acriflavine.<The effects of acriflavine on two species of Trypanosomatidae, Crithidia luciliae and Trypanosoma mega, have been investigated. It has been observed that kinetoplastic (i.e. mitochondrial) DNA is lost in a high percentage of acriflavine-treated cells. Resting flagellates, from stationary-phase or hemin-deficient cultures, are considerably more resistant to the acridine than are flagellates from a log-phase culture. When the kinetoplast has retained some DNA and still remains visible in stained smears, it appears reduced in size, and its ultrastructure is extremely abnormal: the DNA fibrils, clearly visible in normal kinetoplasts, are condensed; they appear as an electron-opaque, apparently homogeneous mass, separated from the membranes by a space of low electron-opacity. Analyses of DNA extracts, with high speed centrifugation in CsCl density gradients, revealed that the satellite band, presumably kinetoplastic DNA, is lost by trypanosomes grown for 5 days in the presence of acriflavine. Radioautography was used to study the effects of acriflavine on thymidine-(3)H incorporation in C. luciliae. At the concentration which affects the kinetoplast specifically, the dye produces an 87% inhibition of thymidine incorporation in this organelle. The kinetics of this inhibition suggest a direct effect on replication. No decrease in incorporation occurs in the nucleus. These results lead to the conclusion that loss of kinetoplastic DNA is due to continued growth and cell division in the absence of kinetoplastic DNA replication. Several hypotheses are discussed concerning the specificity of the dye's action upon the replication of extrachromosomal DNA.<Acridines, pharmacology, Animals, Autoradiography, Cell Division, Cell Nucleus, metabolism, Centrifugation, Density Gradient, Chromosomes, metabolism, DNA, biosynthesis, metabolism, Kinetics, Microscopy, Electron, Mitochondria, metabolism, Organoids, metabolism, Thymidine, metabolism, Tritium, Trypanosoma, drug effects, growth &amp; development
16040582<The action of tubocurarine and atropine on the normal and denervated rat diaphragm.<1. The potency with which tubocurarine chloride (TC) and atropine sulphate (AS) influence the amplitude of the end-plate potentials was measured in the rat diaphragm. This effect was compared with the action of these drugs on brief depolarizations evoked by iontophoretic application of ACh to end-plate-free spots of the chronically denervated fibre.2. TC and AS act similarly on e.p.p.s, but the concentrations necessary to cause the same effect are 2000-times higher for AS.3. The dose-response curves for both inhibitors are unchanged by prostigmine.4. Ten to twenty-five days after denervation the ACh-potentials of the sensitized end-plate-free parts of the membrane are less responsive to curare than the normal e.p.p.s are. AS is as effective in blocking ACh potentials of denervated muscles as it is in blocking normal e.p.p.s. The curare/atropine coefficient (dose ratio for equal effect) is 0.0005 for e.p.p.s and 0.003 for ACh potentials of the denervated membrane.5. Both blocking drugs reduce the amplitude of ACh-potentials evoked in the end-plate region of normally innervated rat diaphragm fibres as effectively as they reduce the amplitude of e.p.p.s.6. Neither TC nor AS have a presynaptic action in concentrations markedly reducing the e.p.p. amplitude.<Acetylcholine, pharmacology, Animals, Atropine, pharmacology, Denervation, Diaphragm, drug effects, innervation, Electrophysiology, Female, In Vitro Techniques, Muscle Contraction, drug effects, Myofibrils, drug effects, Nerve Endings, drug effects, physiology, Phrenic Nerve, physiology, Rats, Tubocurarine, pharmacology
16040583<Altered temperature and taste responses from cross-regenerated sensory nerves in the rat's tongue.<1. The chorda tympani nerve, which innervates the front of the rat tongue, was found to be much less responsive to tongue cooling than the IXth nerve, which innervates the back of the tongue. The two nerves also differed in their relative responsiveness to various taste chemicals.2. Through cross-union the IXth nerve was made to innervate the front of the tongue, and in other rats the chorda tympani nerve the back of the tongue.3. After an average of 15 post-operative weeks, electrophysiological recordings of whole nerve action potential discharges were made from normal, control regenerated, and cross-regenerated nerves. Cooling, and chemical and mechanical stimulation of the tongue demonstrated that the control regenerated and cross-regenerated nerves had established functional connexions.4. Neither the response to cooling nor the relative taste responses were altered by either of two types of control chorda tympani nerve regeneration.5. In contrast, the cross-regenerated chorda increased its responsiveness to tongue cooling and the cross-regenerated IXthe nerve lost much of its responsiveness to cooling.6. Cross-regeneration also caused the relative taste responses to change and appear quite similar to the responses obtained from the nerve which normally innervated that tongue region (e.g. the cross-regenerated IXth nerve responded like a chorda tympani nerve).7. It is suggested that the sensory response evoked in the chorda tympani and IXth nerves by tongue cooling or taste stimulation is at least partially dependent upon the character of the tongue tissue in which the nerve terminates-the epithelium at the front differs from that at the back of the rat tongue.8. These results rule out the following two hypotheses: (a) that the nerve ending itself functions as a taste receptor in direct contact with applied chemicals and yet is uninfluenced by the character of the tissue in which it terminates, (b) that assuming the taste bud cells are an integral part of the receptive process, the taste nerve ending determines the chemical specificity of the taste cell which it induces, without any previous modification of the nerve by the tissue in which it terminates.<Action Potentials, Animals, Chorda Tympani Nerve, physiology, Cold Temperature, Electrophysiology, Glossopharyngeal Nerve, physiology, Nerve Endings, physiology, Nerve Regeneration, physiology, Rats, Taste, Taste Buds, physiology, Thermosensing, Tongue, innervation, physiology
16040584<The relative roles of the aortic and carotid sinus nerves in the rabbit in the control of respiration and circulation during arterial hypoxia and hypercapnia.<1. The respiratory and circulatory effects of graded arterial hypoxia, alone or with superadded hypercapnia, were studied in four groups of unanaesthetized rabbits including normal animals and those with selective section of the aortic nerves, selective section of the carotid sinus nerves and section of both sets of nerves.2. When measured 2-4 days after selective section of the carotid sinus nerves the resting respiratory minute volume and arterial P(O2) were lower and the P(CO2) higher than normal. These effects were not observed after selective section of the aortic nerves. Selective aortic nerve section, and selective carotid sinus nerve section each produced a similar increase in the resting arterial pressure and heart rate, but were without effect on the resting cardiac output.3. During arterial hypoxia reflex respiratory and circulatory effects ascribable to arterial chemoreceptor stimulation (hyperventilation, bradycardia, vasoconstriction) were mediated for the most part through the carotid sinus nerve. In animals with only the aortic nerves intact the circulatory response was determined largely by the opposing effects of aortic baroreceptor reflexes and the local peripheral dilator action of hypoxia.4. The circulatory effects of hyperventilation induced by hypercapnia during arterial hypoxia, in animals with both aortic and carotid sinus nerves cut were small.5. The results suggest that relatively few chemoreceptor fibres originate from the aortic region in the rabbit, though the carotid sinus and aortic nerves both contain baroreceptor fibres.<Animals, Aorta, innervation, Blood Circulation, physiology, Blood Pressure, Carbon Dioxide, blood, pharmacology, Cardiac Output, physiology, Carotid Body, physiology, Carotid Sinus, innervation, Heart Rate, physiology, Hypercapnia, Hypoxia, physiopathology, Oximetry, Rabbits, Respiration, physiology, Sensory Receptor Cells, physiology
16040889<Selective inhibition of absorption and long distance transport in relation to the dual mechanisms of ion absorption in maize seedlings.<The influence of several uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation and inhibitors of terminal electron transport was studied on absorption and long distance transport of both K and C1 at concentrations within each range of the dual isotherm typical of ion uptake by maize roots. At low concentrations in the range of system 1, the system considered to implement ion movement through the plasma membrane, root absorption and long distance transport are equally inhibited by a given inhibitor. In the high range of system 2, the system considered to mediate ion passage through the tonoplast, long distance transport is markedly less sensitive to inhibitors than is absorption. The observations are in accord with the hypothesis that only system 1 is involved in the uptake of ions from the external solution into the symplast, and hence into the xylem. At high concentrations, entrance into the symplasm is deemed to be largely by diffusion and therefore less inhibitor sensitive. With respect to absorption by the roots, the plasma membrane system is more inhibitor sensitive than is the tonoplast system. It is suggested that the difference in sensitivity is real, and not the consequence of an inequality of inhibitor concentration in the vicinity of the plasma membrane and tonoplast respectively.<Biological Transport, Enzymes, Potassium, metabolism, Sodium, metabolism, Zea mays, metabolism
16040890<Inhibition of early steps in the gibberellin-activated synthesis of alpha-amylase.<Subsequent production of amylase is severely inhibited if barban [4-chloro-2-butynyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate] is added to embryo-free half seeds of barley within 4 to 5 hours after gibberellic acid treatment of these seeds. Thirty to 50 mg/L concentrations of barban are effective. Barban inhibition is non-competitive with respect to gibberellic acid. Addition of barban 7 hours or more after gibberellic acid treatment is almost without effect. The delay between gibberellic acid treatment and amylase formation tends to become shorter with more prolonged imbibition periods. Regardless of imbibition period, susceptibility to barban is lost within 7 hours after gibberellic acid treatment. Other herbicidally active phenylurethanes are also inhibitors, but none are as effective as barban. Phenethyl alcohol and 2 arylcarbamates can act as inhibitors.<Amylases, biosynthesis, Edible Grain, metabolism, Gibberellins, pharmacology, Herbicides, Plant Growth Regulators, Plants, enzymology, Seeds
16040891<Microbiology of saturated salt solutions and other harsh environments. II. Ribonucleotide dependency in the growth of a salt-habituated Penicillium notatum in salt-free nutrient media.<A strain of Penicillium notatum has been found growing upon media containing saturated calcium acetate which upon passage through media containing saturated KC1 loses its ability to grow at normal rates in salt-free glucose-peptone medium. This salt-habituated form can be restored to a near-normal growth rate by adding yeast extract, RNA or RNA-hydrolysates, but not by DNA or its hydrolysate. The 4 RNA nucleotides in combination replace yeast extract whereas riboside and base combinations do not. Adenylic, guanylic or cytidilic acids, singly or in various combinations, are even more effective, but uridylic acid alone is not active at all. Ribonucleotide pairs including uridylic acid are less active, but 3 ribonucleotide combinations are highly effective, even in the presence of uridylic acid. Differential effects were evident in mycelial form and sporulation, as well as growth. In addition to a direct role in Penicillium RNA metabolism, the significance of ribonucleotides in energy metabolism or cell wall synthesis is mentioned as alternatives to explain their restorative effects.<Culture Media, Nucleotides, metabolism, Penicillium, growth &amp; development, metabolism, RNA, metabolism, Salts, metabolism, Yeasts

16040893<The isoperoxidases of Pisum sativum.<The heterogeneity of the peroxidases in peas was examined by starch gel electrophoresis. Comparisons were made between tall and dwarf cultivars and among organ systems developed in light and darkness. Isoperoxidase bands could be grouped as cathodic, anodic and near-neutral (at pH 9.0) types. The cathodic set stained well with guaiacol oxidation products whereas some anodic bands reacted preferentially with 2,6-dimethoxyphenol. Some near-neutral bands were aceto-carmine positive and may have been organellar. Each organ had a characteristic isozyme pattern, and the band patterns in corresponding organs from different varieties were far more alike than were the patterns in the different organs within each variety. Ontogenetic changes were marked in all 3 organ systems, principally in the cathodic bands. The effect of light on isozymal patterns was quantitative rather than qualitative, possibly influencing the isoperoxidases secondarily via its effect upon organ physiology and development.<Electrophoresis, Isoenzymes, analysis, Peroxidases, analysis, Plants, Edible, enzymology
16040894<Movement of pulses of labeled auxin in corn coleoptiles.<The transit of indole-3-acetic acid through 20-mm sections of corn coleoptiles can be separated from processes involved in the uptake of auxin by the section and the exit of auxin from the section. Aerobic sections are supplied with an exogenous source of (14)C IAA for a limited time, and after the source is removed, a pulse of (14)C IAA moves down at 12 to 15 mm/hour. After transfer to nitrogen, movement of the pulse at the aerobic rate persists for about 10 minutes; thereafter drops to only 1 to 2 mm/hour and remains at this level during the next 4 hours. Within 2 hours, 70% of the total (14)C in aerobic sections has moved 10 mm or more down the section from the position of the initial peak, whereas after the same time in nitrogen less than 10% of the total (14)C has moved as far. During the migration down the coleoptile, the peak of radioactivity becomes broader and less distinct. This dispersion is more rapid in aerobic than anaerobic sections, but appears to be nonpolar and to occur along the existing concentration gradients. Diffusion probably contributes to this dispersion. In both inhibited and uninhibited sections, the movement of the peak, in contrast to its dispersion, is A) polar (downward) and B) independent of existing concentration gradients. Thus transit within the section possesses the fundamental properties of the overall transport system. The reduced amount of transport in inhibited sections is more likely maintained by glycolysis than by a low level of aerobic respiration dependent on the residual oxygen in the tissue.<Biological Transport, Carbon Isotopes, Glycolysis, Indoleacetic Acids, metabolism, Plant Growth Regulators, metabolism, Zea mays
16040895<Inhibition of cell elongation in Avena coleoptile by hydroxyproline.<A study has been made of the hydroxyproline-induced inhibition of elongation of Avena coleoptile tissues. The isomers of 4-hydroxyproline differ in their effectiveness; only the L isomers are growth inhibitors with the cis form (allohydroxyproline) being more effective than the trans form (hydroxyproline). Hydroxyproline differs from other amino acid antagonists and protein synthesis inhibitors in respect to 2 characteristics of the growth inhibition. First, a certain increment of auxin-induced elongation must take place following addition of hydroxyproline before the growth is inhibited. In contrast, pretreatment with other amino acid antagonists or protein synthesis inhibitors completely eliminates the ability of Avena coleoptile sections to respond to auxin. Secondly, sucrose markedly increases the magnitude of the hydroxyproline inhibition; i.e., sucrose acts to inhibit rather than promote growth when in the presence of hydroxyproline. It appears that hydroxyproline is a specific inhibitor for the synthesis of some factor which is utilized in elongation. Following addition of hydroxyproline, auxin-induced elongation continues until the pool of this factor is exhausted; then elongation is inhibited.<Edible Grain, cytology, Hydroxyproline, pharmacology, Plant Growth Regulators
16040896<Orotidine-5'-phosphate decarboxylase and pyrophosphorylase of bean leaves.<This report includes results demonstrating the existence of orotidine-5'-phosphate decarboxylase and orotidine-5'-phosphate pyrophosphorylase in plant leaves. The decarboxylase enzyme, purified 8 fold from leaves of etiolated pinto beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), had a pH optimum of 6.3. It was strongly inhibited by 6-azauridine-5'-phosphate; a concentration of 12 mum decreased the reaction rate 60%. The enzyme was not dependent upon magnesium ions or inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoate. It was present in other parts of the bean plant and was found in young leaves of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) and Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense L.)The enzyme orotidine-5'-phosphate pyrophosphorylase, which catalyzes the formation of orotidine-5'-phosphate from orotic acid and 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate, was found in the etiolated bean leaves, and was also present in the leaves of tomato and Canada thistle. It was stimulated by manganous or magnesium ions and had a pH optimum of 7.2. The K(m) value obtained by varying the concentrations of 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate was 75 mum, and when orotic acid was varied the resulting K(m) was 3.5 mum. The presence of these 2 enzymes in higher plants, combined with previous results with inhibitors and labeled metabolites, indicates that the normal pathway of pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis in higher plants proceeds through orotic acid and OMP.<Carboxy-Lyases, metabolism, Nucleotides, biosynthesis, Orotic Acid, metabolism, Plants, Edible, enzymology, Pyrophosphatases, metabolism
16041824<Retrieving the irretrievable; or the editor, the author, and the machine.<Present day programs of computerized information retrieval overvalue the importance of retrieving "facts" without either attaching a scale of importance to the material with which they deal or ordering information in any way which corresponds to the order of human thought. The limitations of classification by subject heading become especially apparent when a body of information becomes, through new insight, pertinent to a new area of thought. That body of information thereby acquires new subject headings: thus one sees that the system of retrieval by subject heading can never serve to aid fundamental discovery. The dangers of the present approach lie in their devaluation of traditional methods. Critical reviews are devalued, personal knowledge of the literature is devalued, and a false impression is created that knowledge is the same thing as retrievable information. This diminishes respect for that sort of personal organization of knowledge which alone can serve creative insight.<Abstracting and Indexing, Computers, Information Systems
16041825<The neurological information network of the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Blindness.<The National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Blindness (NINDB) has the responsibility of trying to alleviate the morbid and mortal effects of all the diseases of the nervous system and the special senses including speech, hearing, and vision. The information problem facing the NINDB is only a fraction of the total information problem of the biomedical community, but it is probably representative. The NINDB information audience has a core of about 19,000 persons, 10 percent of whom are nonclinical research scientists; 10 percent of whom are engaged in patient care, teaching, and some research; 12 percent in training (post doctoral); and 68 percent chiefly involved in the care of patients. In addition, there is an unknown number of other interested scientists. Fifty to eighty thousand journal articles, an unknown number of technical reports, and other items produced each year are potentially valuable to this group. The exact needs of each subgroup must be identified and ways developed to deliver the required information quickly, accurately, and in an easily useable form. NINDB has undertaken a large information program as a service to the biomedical community to help cope with these information problems. This program is to serve the needs of the practicing physician, the research scientist, and NINDB program analysis and planning. The Neurological Information Network is the core effort of the program.The Neurological Information Network envisions large units incorporating both information storage and retrieval and information analysis. These will be in universities with strong biomedical libraries where there are ongoing research programs in some area relevant to NINDB responsibilities. These units are to be integrated and will interact with each other and with the National Library of Medicine to avoid duplication of work. In addition to their own information analysis activities, the major documentation centers will be able to support information analysis satellites at other research centers where specific categorical research programs are underway.<Blindness, Humans, Information Systems, National Institutes of Health (U.S.), National Library of Medicine (U.S.), Nervous System Diseases, United States

16041833<Steps towards a computer-based library network: a survey of three medical libraries.<The introduction of a computerized biomedical network in three medical libraries in the State University of New York demanded a study of the various bibliographic records held by the libraries. The investigation produced figures relating to the total number of monographs held by each library and the number of unique titles owned by the network as a whole. These were broken down to identify the amount of works dating from 1962 or later, and estimates were made of the mean length of the normal bibliographic record, as well as of its traditional subareas. Thought was given to the implication of applying depth-indexing to monographs with reference to the length of the record.<Computers, Libraries, Medical, New York
16041834<Analysis of recorded biomedical book and journal use in the Yale Medical Library. I. Date and subject relations.<Analysis of book and journal circulation is based on cancelled charge slips collected over a one-year period in the Yale Medical Library. About two-fifths of material circulated were monographs. Books and journals in seven subject fields provided over half of the circulation. Approximately two-thirds of both books and journals used had been published during the most recent nine years. A subject-by-subject examination of the ratio of books to journals circulating revealed that, in subjects where proportionally more journals than books were taken out of the Library, books were of more recent imprint dates than were journals, contrary to the overall pattern. Date distribution of books and journals by subject was also studied. Results are illustrated with graphs and tables.<Books, Connecticut, Libraries, Medical, Library Surveys, Periodicals as Topic, Statistics as Topic

Subject and user relations.<Cancelled charge slips collected over a one-year period supply the data for this analysis of circulation in the Yale Medical Library. Full-time teaching faculty are the heaviest users of journal literature, and students, of monograph literature. Faculties of Medical School departments are compared in terms of their use of material in individual subjects. Subject literatures are analyzed in terms of groups of users borrowing from them. The extent to which journal titles used by medical students are also used by Medical School faculty is examined. One of the products of the study is a rank list of journal titles used in the Library.

The frequency codes used are based on the date printed on the journal rather than on the expected date of receipt, which allows for more stability in the coding scheme. The journal's volume number and issue number, which in other systems are usually predetermined by a computer, are inserted at the time of check-in.

16041837<The hospital library committee: its composition and tasks.<Since a sizeable hospital must have a library, it must have a library committee. Like all hospital committees, this one is to help maintain standards of medical care and to mediate between staff and administration. Unlike others, it clusters around one elected member (the chairman) and one employee (the librarian). A dynamic librarian can, and should, influence and inspire the committee's deliberations; and must be able to depend upon the support of the physician members of the committee.<Libraries, Hospital, Library Administration
16041838<There's nothing like pushing a button.<Only lack of imagination can now limit the possibilities in the expansion of library service. As part of the medical team the librarian's future is of greater importance than ever before. Communication can soon provide information to all members of the medical group regardless of location. It is through use of machines, available now and in the future, that librarians, freed from routine and time-consuming tasks, may be able to provide greater service. To keep in step with the rapid changes in medicine, it is imperative that the librarian take a new look at his profession and step into those seven league boots.<Computers, Libraries, Medical
16041839<A suggested approach to a library building program.<The preliminary building program suggested in this paper makes use of outlines, graphs, charts, and lists, rather than long-winded paragraphs, to describe the needs, objectives, and philosophy of the library. It is hoped that a short, concise, but detailed, report using these methods will save time and make the report more attractive to read, thereby encouraging the many people who will need to assist in the building planning to use the report.<Architecture, Libraries, Medical, Library Administration
16042356<Metabolic processes in cytoplasmic particles of the avocado fruit. IX. The oxidation of pyruvate and malate during the climacteric cycle.<Mitochondria isolated from preclimacteric avocado fruit oxidize pyruvate at a much lower rate than those separated from climacteric fruit. The external addition of thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) increased the rate of pyruvate oxidation in both cases. The study of the influence of TPP on the rate of oxidation of malate by mitochondria obtained from both preclimacteric and climacteric fruit indicated that the effect of this cofactor could be understood by assuming that malate was converted to pyruvate. TPP stimulation of malate oxidation was prevented by arsenite, an inhibitor of keto acid oxidation. The addition of glutamate increased the rate of malate oxidation through the transamination of oxaloacetate. This suggests that the rate of oxidation of malate is highly dependent upon mechanisms which remove oxaloacetate efficiently. Incubation of mitochondria from preclimacteric fruit with malate-U-(14)C resulted in the labeling of oxaloacetate and the accumulation of labeled pyruvate. Addition of TPP to this system induced the rapid formation of citrate. This conversion was completely inhibited by arsenite. The results indicate that the ability to carry out the oxidative decarboxylation of alpha-ketoacids improves as the ripening process progresses. The idea was advanced that TPP available to the mitochondria plays an important controlling role.<Carbon Isotopes, Fruit, In Vitro Techniques, Malates, metabolism, Mitochondria, metabolism, Oxidation-Reduction, Plants, metabolism, Pyruvates, metabolism, Thiamine Pyrophosphate, pharmacology
16042357<Photosynthesis in Rhodospirillum rubrum. I. Autotrophic carbon dioxide fixation.<The incorporation and distribution of activity from (14)CO(2) was investigated under autotrophic conditions in the facultative photoautotroph, Rhodospirillum rubrum, with cells cultured on hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and ammonium sulfate. In 1 second (14)CO(2) fixation experiments essentially all of the activity was found in 3-phosphoglyceric acid: plotted against time percent incorporation into phosphate esters has a strikingly negative slope. These results suggest that under autotrophic conditions the reductive pentose phosphate cycle or the key reactions of the cycle play a major role in carbon metabolism in this photosynthetic bacterium. Incorporation into amino acids and into intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle was quite low.<Carbon, metabolism, Carbon Dioxide, metabolism, Carbon Isotopes, Pentosephosphates, metabolism, Photosynthesis, Rhodospirillum, metabolism
16042358<Photosynthesis in Rhodospirillum rubrum. II. Photoheterotrophic carbon dioxide fixation.<The contribution of the reductive pentose phosphate cycle to the photometabolism of carbon dioxide and to carbon metabolism in Rhodospirillum rubrum grown photoheterotrophically with l-malate as the carbon source is nil, unlike autotrophically grown R. rubrum. Glycolic acid appears to be the first stable product of CO(2) fixation in R. rubrum cultured photoheterotrophically on l-malate. The results obtained in (14)CO(2) fixation experiments suggest that the photometabolism of CO(2) through glycolate into malate is a major pathway of CO(2) fixation in such cells. However, l-malate was a much more efficient precursor of phosphate esters, and of glutamic acid, than was carbon dioxide; l-malate is therefore, in this case, a far more important source of cell carbon than is carbon dioxide. The products of the light-dependent incorporation of CO(2) and of acetate were investigated in R. rubrum grown photoheterotrophically on acetate. Carboxylation reactions and the reductive pentose phosphate cycle are apparently of greater significance in the photometabolism of acetate heterotrophs than in malate heterotrophs; the photometabolism of the acetate photoheterotrophs seems to be intermediate between the photoheterotrophy of malate heterotrophs and strict autotrophy.<Carbon, metabolism, Carbon Dioxide, metabolism, Carbon Isotopes, Glycolates, metabolism, Malates, metabolism, Photosynthesis, Rhodospirillum, metabolism
16042359<Photosynthesis in Rhodospirillum rubrum. 3. Metabolic control of reductive pentose phosphate and tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes.<Enzymes of the reductive pentose phosphate cycle including ribulose-diphosphate carboxylase, ribulose-5-phosphate kinase, ribose-5-phosphate isomerase, aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and alkaline fructose-1,6-diphos-phatase were shown to be present in autotrophically grown Rhodospirillum rubrum. Enzyme levels were measured in this organism grown photo- and dark heterotrophically as well. Several, but not all, of these enzymes appeared to be under metabolic control, mediated by exogenous carbon and nitrogen compounds. Light had no effect on the presence or levels of any of these enzymes in this photosynthetic bacterium. The enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and enolase were shown to be present in R. rubrum cultured aerobically, autotrophically, or photoheterotrophically, both in cultures evolving hydrogen and under conditions where hydrogen evolution is not observed.

16042360<3-Methyleneoxindole reductase of peas.<A 100-fold purification of a reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide/3-methyleneoxindole reductase of peas has been achieved using conventional protein fractionation procedures. Reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide is 25-fold less effective than reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide as the reductant. The preparation is free of other reductase activities including those linking the oxidation of reduced pyridine nucleotide coenzymes to the reduction of cytochrome c; vitamins K(1), K(2), and K(3); O(2); nitrate; oxidized glutathione; and thiazolyl blue tetrazolium. The affinity of the enzyme for 3-methyleneoxindole (K(s) = 0.5 mm 3-methyleneoxindole) is relatively high. It is, therefore, reasonable to assume that 3-methyleneoxindole is the normal substrate.The enzyme is inhibited by indole-3-acetic acid, indole-3-aldehyde, and by l-naph-thaleneacetic acid. While these are not especially powerful inhibitors (K(1) = 1.9-4.0 mm) the competitive relationship with 3-methyleneoxindole indicates that significant inhibition might occur at low intracellular concentrations of the substrate.<Coenzymes, metabolism, Enzymes, metabolism, Nucleotides, metabolism, Oxidoreductases, metabolism, Plants, enzymology, Vegetables
16042361<Mevalonic acid kinase in Euglena gracilis.<The isolation and partial purification of mevalonic acid kinase from Euglena gracilis is described. The product of the reaction MVA-5-P has been characterized by paper chromatography. The apparent Km values for l-mevalonic acid, ATP, and Mg(2+) are 3 x 10(-5)m, 6 x 10(-3)m, and 9 x 10(-3)m, respectively. A concentration of 1 x 10(-3)mp-hydroxymercuribenzoate completely inactivates the enzyme. A distribution study has shown that mevalonic acid kinase is present in most higher plants and the algae Euglena gracilis and Chlamydomonas.

16042362<Enhancement of photosynthesis by alternated light beams and a kinetic model.<Using the alga Chlorella and 2 light beams of defined wavelength, we have found that short period (1 sec) alternation gives all characteristics of enhancement of net oxygen evolution observed when the beams are superimposed. With increasing period of alternation (1-20 see) decay in enhancement is more rapid at higher intensities. We have developed a kinetic model for the current hypothesis of 2 photoacts operating in series and separated by electron transport reactions. The model is applicable at low light intensity such that rate is governed only by intensities and the fractions of reaction centers open for each photoact. Potentials and pool sizes of intermediates were taken from current estimates. Wavelength dependency of the 2 photoacts was taken from enhancement spectra for superimposed light beams. Analog computer treatment of the kinetic equations gave predictions of chromatic transients and alternated enhancement which are in reasonable but not complete agreement with experimental observations.<Chemical Phenomena, Chemistry, Physical, Computers, Analog, Eukaryota, metabolism, Kinetics, Light, Models, Theoretical, Photosynthesis
16043615<Rapid method for measuring extracellular water in yeast preparations.<A rapid procedure for the quantitative determination of extracellular water in bulk bakers' yeast was developed on the basis of the solute dilution principle. A reagent is prepared by synthesizing the diazonium ion of p-aminobenzoic acid and coupling it to peptone. This "azopeptone reagent" permits direct colorimetric measurement, which accounts for the rapidity and simplicity of the test. Potential errors due to osmotic effects are avoided by supplementing the reagent with saline and, more importantly, minimizing the duration of contact between reagent and cells. The new method has acceptable accuracy and precision, and may also be suitable for use with other microorganisms.<Colorimetry, Osmosis, Peptones, pharmacology, Saccharomyces, analysis, Water

16044295<Hirsutism and virilization.<In normal females, androstenedione from both the adrenal cortex and ovary, as a result of peripheral conversion, is the source of the majority of biologically active testosterone in the circulation. The control of the secretion of precursor steroid and androgenic hormone (testosterone) in females is not clear at this time. There are a number of possibilities to explain various types of hirsutism and virilization. The presence of true virilization indicates a significant disorder and requires complete investigation. The presence of increased amounts of 17-ketosteroids in the urine implicates the adrenal cortex as a source of the pathologic manifestations. The suppressibility of elevated 17-ketosteroids with cortisol analogues aids in distinguishing between adrenal hyperplasia and autonomous neoplasm of the adrenal cortex. By far the most common entity in this area is simple hirsutism without virilization. Although our knowledge of this disorder is quite incomplete, conservative management is indicated. Further progress in this field is rapidly occurring. An informed clinician can do an adequate job of diagnosis and treatment with the clinical and laboratory tools generally available.<Androgens, blood, urine, Female, Hirsutism, etiology, Humans, Virilism, etiology

Three central tumor registries (in California, Connecticut and Massachusetts) plus nine individual hospital registries (in university hospitals) are participating in the program. During the period 1940-59, there was an encouraging increase in five-year survival rates among patients with carcinomas and sarcomas (solid tumors). Preliminary data for 1955-59 suggest that the upward trend is leveling off. A smaller absolute increase in five-year survival rates occurred among patients with lymphomas and leukemia. These increases in patient survival rates coincided with more frequent use of surgical operation for solid tumors and more frequent use of chemotherapy for lymphomas and leukemia.<Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Neoplasms, epidemiology, mortality, therapy
16045293<Alpha-linoleate and photosynthetic activity in Chlorella protothecoides.<Green cells of Chlorella protothecoides grown in nitrogen-rich low glucose media may be reversibly transformed to entirely chlorophyll-less cells in low nitrogen high glucose media. Photosynthetic rates and fatty ester compositions were determined during light and dark bleaching and during greening. Linolenic acid content remained unchanged during greening or bleaching. During light greening chlorophyll content and photosynthetic activity increased while oleic acid content decreased dramatically. As a result, the percent composition of linolenate appeared to parallel photosynthetic capability. Implication of alpha-linolenate in oxygen production, therefore, can not be based upon fatty acid percentage composition data alone.<Eukaryota, metabolism, Linoleic Acids, metabolism, Oleic Acids, metabolism, Photosynthesis
16045295<Peroxidase associated with higher plant mitochondria.<The presence of peroxidase in mitochondria from etiolated mung bean hypocotyls and skunk cabbage spadices, suggested by carbon monoxide difference spectra and the spectral response to methyl hydroperoxide, was shown to result from contamination of the isolated mitochondria by a denser particle fraction with high peroxidase activity. The mitochondria themselves have no peroxidatic activity. Analysis of the homogenate of mung bean hypocotyls revealed that over 90% of the peroxidase was soluble, as expected. Sonication of the isolated mitochondria, however, did not remove all the peroxidase from the particulate fraction, indicating that some of this enzyme is tightly bound to a membrane. These results suggest that the peroxidase in plant cells is localized in lysosomes or microbodies, most of which are ruptured on tissue homogenization to give soluble peroxidase, but some of which survive and appear as membrane bound peroxidase.<Lysosomes, enzymology, Mitochondria, enzymology, Peroxidases, metabolism, Plants, enzymology, Spectrophotometry
16045296<Glycolate pathway in algae.<No glycolate oxidase activity could be detected by manometric, isotopic, or spectrophotometric techniques in cell extracts from 5 strains of algae grown in the light with CO(2). However, NADH:glyoxylate reductase, phosphoglycolate phosphatase and isocitrate dehydrogenase were detected in the cell extracts. The serine formed by Chlorella or Chlamydomonas after 12 seconds of photosynthetic (14)CO(2) fixation contained 70 to 80% of its (14)C in the carboxyl carbon. This distribution of label in serine was similar to that in phosphoglycerate from the same experiment. Thus, in algae serine is probably formed directly from phosphoglycerate. These results differ from those of higher plants which form uniformly labeled serine from glycolate in short time periods when phosphoglycerate is still carboxyl labeled. In glycolate formed by algae in 5 and 10 seconds of (14)CO(2) fixation, C(2) was at least twice as radioactive as C(1). A similar skewed labeling in C(2) and C(3) of 3-phosphoglycerate and serine suggests a common precursor for glycolate and 3-phosphoglycerate. Glycine formed by the algae, however, from the same experiments was uniformly labeled. Manganese deficient Chlorella incorporated only 2% of the total (14)CO(2) fixed in 10 minutes into glycolate, while in normal Chlorella 30% of the total (14)C was found in glycolate. Manganese deficient Chlorella also accumulated more (14)C in glycine and serine.Glycolate excretion by Chlorella was maximal in 10 mm bicarbonate and occurred only in the light, and was not influenced by the addition of glycolate. No time dependent uptake of significant amounts of either glycolate or phosphoglycolate was observed. When small amounts of glycolate-2-(14)C were fed to Chlorella or Scenedesmus, only 2 to 3% was metabolized after 30 to 60 minutes. The algae were not capable of significant glycolate metabolism as is the higher plant. The failure to detect glycolate oxidase, the low level glycolate-(14)C metabolism, and the formation of serine from phosphoglycerate rather than from glycolate are consistent with the concept of an incomplete glycolate pathway in algae.<Carbon Isotopes, Eukaryota, enzymology, Glycolates, metabolism, Manganese, metabolism, Oxidoreductases, metabolism

Development of fatty acid synthetase as a function of protein synthesis in aging potato tuber slices.<Experiments with inhibitors of protein synthesis (actinomycin D, puromycin, actidione) showed that the increase and the change in fatty acid synthetase activity, observed during the aging of potato disks, were accompanied by and related to a temporary rise in the rate of protein and RNA synthesis. These results concur with the earlier suggestion by Click and Hackett that the aging process involves a type of derepression. A possible course of events during aging, and possible derepression mechanisms are suggested and discussed.<Aging, Carbon Isotopes, Dactinomycin, pharmacology, Enzymes, pharmacology, Fatty Acids, metabolism, Ligases, metabolism, Plant Proteins, biosynthesis, Plants, Edible, enzymology, RNA, biosynthesis

With etiolated soybean hypocotyl, maize mesocotyl and Avena coleoptile sections and light-grown pea internode sections, inhibition of RNA synthesis resulted in inhibition of auxin-induced extensibility changes and cell expansion. The results with both actinomycin D and cycloheximide support an earlier conclusion that unstable cell constituents, presumably enzymes, are essential for cell wall loosening induced by auxin as well as for cell elongation.<Cell Wall, Dactinomycin, pharmacology, Plant Growth Regulators, pharmacology, Plants, enzymology, RNA, biosynthesis

16045471<Overweight, obesity and weight control.<Evidence is cited showing that overweight is a health hazard, but that this is primarily true only when the excess weight is due to an excess accumulation of adipose tissue. Diagnosis of frank obesity should be established by a careful interpretation of height-weight tables and of all other pertinent data. Although many factors play an etiologic role, obesity can occur only when caloric intake exceeds caloric output, and can be obviated only when this imbalance is reversed. Therefore prevention of weight gain, which should receive increasing attention, and also satisfactory weight loss, both require that caloric output be increased through added physical activity and that caloric intake be decreased through diminished consumption. Success depends on recognizing the fallacy of all misleading misinformation, and on establishing permanent habits of regular exercise and of moderation in eating and drinking. Suggestions are made that can be effective guidelines to a commonsense program of weight control.<Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Body Weight, Child, Diet, Reducing, Humans, Middle Aged, Obesity, prevention &amp; control

The story continues:"It's the latest way to travel, or so say a growing group of devotees on the campus," the university student paper said. "It can produce much the same effects as psychedelic drugs, they claim, and it's cheaper to obtain.""One student said he buys the gas, nitrous oxide, from a medical supply house. ;They think I am anesthetizing rats,' he explained."Campus medical authorities said the gas, sniffed ;in sufficient amounts... could produce all the states of anesthesia, including the final stage-death.'"<Adolescent, Adult, California, Hallucinogens, adverse effects, Heroin, Humans, Nitrous Oxide, adverse effects, Substance-Related Disorders
16045473<Poikilocytosis in cancer patients.<The incidence of poikilocytosis in 100 patients with cancer of various organ systems was found to be 12 per cent. Poikilocytosis was more frequently seen in patients with adenocarcinoma of the gastrointestinal tract and with inoperable metastatic carcinoma than in patients with other malignant lesions. Anemia was associated in three cases, but in nine instances the patient was not significantly anemic at admission. Two of these patients may have been dehydrated. Uremia was not a factor in any of the cases. Fifty per cent of the patients exhibiting poikilocytosis died or were in a terminal condition within one month after the observation was made, as compared with 21 per cent of the patients who did not have evidence of poikilocytosis. These findings show that poikilocytosis may occur in cancer patients without anemia or uremia; and they indicate that its presence is an unfavorable prognosis sign.<Adult, Aged, Erythrocytes, Female, Gastrointestinal Neoplasms, complications, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Metastasis, Neoplasms, complications, Prognosis

16045481<Poverty in the United States as defined by federal standards. A report of the Bureau of Research and Planning, California Medical Association.<The subject of this Socio-Economic Report is of tremendous importance to the medical profession because physicians should be aware that future programs for the expansion of health care services will be based and, in fact, are being based upon information which this Report contains. The relationship between poverty and accessibility of health care services is therefore quite direct. So, too, will be the impact upon the profession and the organization of medical practice. The 1966 amendments to the Poverty Act are concerned with neighborhood health centers and a vast array of other programs which will touch every physician and every community which can be identified by the standards indicated in this Report as low income, poor, or near poor. For this reason the California Medical Association Committee on Welfare Medical Programs, among several others concerned with aspects of this problem, is trying to alert every county medical society of developments as well as of the responsibilities they should assume in working with the Office of Economic Opportunity and other community organizations in providing guidance and leadership in structuring programs compatible with the interests of the public and the health care professions. This Report on poverty presents a current and prospective view of the problems and issues to be faced. Unless physicians see the relationship and join in a community effort to aid in resolving an issue which underlies public policy, we shall be looking back five or ten years from now to point out that we failed to take advantage of opportunities to assist in the development of a rational system of medical care for low-income groups. Individual physicians, component medical societies on a grass-roots level and CMA as a state organization should all be concerned with and aware of the facts.<California, Economics, History, 20th Century, Humans, Social Conditions, Societies, Medical, Sociology, United States

Less frequently there may be empyema or bronchopleural fistula. Suppression of the infection by antibiotics may protract the course and obscure the clinical findings.

Due to the wide variability in signs and symptoms in children, cholecystitis and cholelithiasis can be diagnosed only with a high degree of clinical suspicion and roentgenological examination. Gallbladder disease is uncommon in childhood but should be considered in children with vague abdominal pains or bouts of unexplained jaundice. If a normal appendix is found at laparotomy in the "acute abdomen," the surgeon would be wise to palpate other specific organs within the abdomen, including the liver and gallbladder. The treatment of choice is cholecystectomy.

16045488<Gonorrhea: the office management of acute infections.<Gonorrhea has recently increased to epidemic proportions and is poorly controlled. The principal causes are probably increasing resistance of Neisseria gonorrheae to penicillin, the difficulty of establishing the diagnosis and proving the cure in female patients and the inadequacy of resources devoted to the eradication of the disease by public health agencies. While examination of smears is adequate for diagnosis of the disease in males, in females cultures of vaginal exudate are necessary. Gonorrhea can usually be successfully treated with large doses of short-acting penicillins. Intramuscular administration of aqueous procaine penicillin will bring about cure in most cases. Female patients should have cultures for several weeks to make sure they are cured. The physician should report all cases to the local health department so that contacts can be traced and treated.<Family Practice, Female, Gonorrhea, diagnosis, drug therapy, Humans, Male, Penicillins, therapeutic use, Procaine, therapeutic use, Public Health Administration, Vaginal Smears

Serum glucose levels of 32 per cent of the men and 36 per cent of the women exceeded 140 mg per 100 ml at the two-hour sampling period. In both sexes, there was a tendency for hyperglycemia to become more conspicuous with age. Under the age of 50, a much higher percentage of women than men had seemingly excessive serum glucose values. These findings may suggest a need for modifying criteria currently used for interpreting glycemic responses to oral glucose challenges.<Adult, Aged, Female, Glucose Tolerance Test, Humans, Hyperglycemia, epidemiology, Male, Middle Aged
16046046<The obese person as an adolescent.<Obesity constitutes a major health problem in the United States. Hypertension, atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, diabetes and gout are often associated with obesity and may be a direct result of persistent obesity in adult life. Obesity frequently has its beginnings in childhood and adolescence. Unfortunately, obesity which develops in early life is a progressive problem. Eighty per cent of overweight children and adolescents will continue to be overweight as adults.(12) Furthermore, adults with a history of obesity in childhood are the most resistant to treatment. Recent studies have shown there is more than one body constitutional type among obese adolescents. Obese adolescents tend to eat less than non-obese controls. While obesity may be found to have many different causative factors, efforts to control this disease may be most successful in the area of primary prevention.<Adolescent, Humans, Obesity, complications, metabolism, therapy

16046571<Enzyme-labeled antibodies for the light and electron microscopic localization of tissue antigens.<Enzymes, either acid phosphatase or horseradish peroxidase, were conjugated to antibodies with bifunctional reagents. The conjugates, enzymatically and immunologically active, were employed in the immunohistochemical localization of tissue antigens utilizing the reaction product of the enzymatic reaction as the marker. Tissues reacted with acid phosphatase-labeled antibodies directed against basement membrane were stained for the enzyme with Gomori's method, and those reacted with peroxidase-labeled antibody were stained with Karnovsky's method. The reaction products of the enzymes localized in the basement membrane. Unlike the preparations of the fluorescent antibody technique, enzyme-labeled antibody preparations were permanent, could be observed with an ordinary microscope, and could be examined with the electron microscope. In the latter, specific localization of antibody occurred in the basement membrane and in the endoplasmic reticulum of cells known to synthesize basement membrane antigens. The method is sensitive because of the amplifying effect of the enzymatic activity. The ultrastructural preservation and localization were better with acid phosphatase-labeled antibody than with peroxidase-labeled antibody, but acid phosphatase conjugated antibody was unstable and difficult to prepare. Peroxidase-antibody conjugates were stable and could be stored for several months at 4 degrees C, or indefiniely in a frozen state.<Acid Phosphatase, Animals, Antigen-Antibody Reactions, Antigens, Cell Nucleus, Endoplasmic Reticulum, Histocytochemistry, Immunochemistry, Microscopy, Microscopy, Electron, Mitochondria, Peroxidases, analysis
16046860<Myasthenia gravis: brief guide to diagnosis and management.<Physicians should consider the possibility of myasthenia gravis in patients complaining of fluctuating muscle weakness and easy fatigability. The disorder may occur in either sex at any age. Repeated measurements of multiple muscle groups and functions to include baseline strength and response to a control as well as anticholinesterase drugs are desirable in reaching a diagnosis. Appropriate doses of anticholinesterase medication reduce weakness and fatigability in most patients. Selected patients may benefit from thymectomy. Patients in crisis failing to respond to anticholinesterase drugs, having difficulty maintaining a patent airway or adequate respiratory exchange are best managed by prompt tracheostomy using a cuffed tube, with adequate tracheobronchial toilet and mechanical respiratory assistance.<Humans, Myasthenia Gravis, diagnosis, therapy
16046861<The role of radiation therapy in myasthenia gravis.<Myasthenia gravis is a serious and debilitating disease associated with conduction defects occurring at the myoneural junction. About 15 per cent of the patients have associated tumors of the thymus and 80 per cent of the remaining patients show abnormalities of the thymus. Although a definite relationship between cause and effect has not been proved, thymectomy or radiotherapy of the thymus does seem to influence the disease. Seven cases of myasthenia gravis in which radiation therapy was used at the University of California Medical Center are reported and compared with those described in the literature. It is concluded that patients whose disease is progressing and not well managed medically, and who have no evidence of thymoma, should be treated by irradiation-whether pre-operatively or as definitive treatment, depending on the result of irradiation. Those patients with evidence of thymoma should be irradiated before surgical procedure. Small tumors, or patients in whom surgical risk is increased, may be managed by radiation therapy alone.<Adult, Aged, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Myasthenia Gravis, radiotherapy

In general, most isolates of the fungus are not susceptible to concentrations within the range of human tolerance. This is particularly true of perfect forms, although this relationship is lacking for some isolates. There is no correlation between the isolation history of a strain and its amphotericin B sensitivity. Susceptibility was found to be absolute in some isolates, whereas resistance could be increased in others through repeated exposure to higher increments of drug. In high concentrations, the antibiotic is uniformly cidal for the spores of certain isolates. This finding was also true for some conidia of "resistant" strains, although the action was fungistatic on other spores in the same population.<Amphotericin B, pharmacology, Ascomycota, drug effects, growth &amp; development

All the radioactive C(24) bile acids recovered were in conjugated form, probably as taurine conjugates. 3.

16048101<Research comparisons. Some limitations of international comparisons of research and development expenditures are considered.<In concluding, I will make some personal value judgments explicit. No value judgments need enter into a comparison of inputs, nor need they intrude into comparisons of technological progress and economic growth, except in the choice of these themes for investigation, but value judgments are inevitably involved in the consideration of policy measures which may flow from such comparisons. Insofar as it represents a conscious political decision, the scale of R &amp; D activity and support for science in any particular country reflects a variety of policy goals, only some of which are economic. Moreover, the balance of "home" R &amp; D and "imported" science and technology must also partly reflect political and cultural, as well as more narrowly conceived economic and technological, goals. My personal preference is for a more research-oriented society, both in Britian and in Europe, but for very different policy goals than those pursued in the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. I regard the proposals being canvassed in Britain for drastically cutting back the rate of growth of fundamental and applied research as short-sighted both culturally and economically, and I believe that the real possibilities of acquiring and using American know-how will depend increasingly on strengthening Europe's own R &amp; D capacity. But wherever the balance may lie, all countries benefit to a very considerable extent from scientific and technological exchanges. Autarchy is inefficient, both for the world economy and for world science and technology.<Europe, Nobel Prize, Research Support as Topic, Technology, USSR, United Kingdom, United States
16048102<Rabbit hemoglobin biosynthesis: use of human hemoglobin chains to study molecule completion.<A cell-free protein-synthesizing system made from rabbit reticulocytes was used to incorporate (14)C-amino acids into hemoglobin. Electrophoretic analyses of the soluble products of this cell-free system revealed a fraction containing rabbit (14)C-alpha chains in addition to the rabbit (14)C-hemoglobin. The addition of isolated human hemoglobin beta chains to this system during active synthesis inhibited the release of newly synthesized rabbit (14)C-beta chains into solution from the ribosome fraction. This inhibition was possibly a result of hybrid hemoglobin formation between rabbit alpha and human beta chains. A model of hemoglobin construction in which soluble alpha chains are intermediates is suggested. These alpha chains may aid in the release of beta chains from the polyribosomes during the completion of the hemoglobin molecule.<Animals, Blood Protein Electrophoresis, Carbon Isotopes, Cell-Free System, Hemoglobins, analysis, biosynthesis, Humans, Peptides, analysis, metabolism, Rabbits, Reticulocytes, cytology, metabolism, Ribosomes, metabolism, Valine, metabolism

16048104<Intracellular pool of unhydroxylated polypeptide precursors of collagen.<The hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine in collagen are synthesized by an apparently unique pathway in which proline and lysine are hydroxylated after they are incorporated into a large polypeptide precursor of collagen called protocollagen. When the hydroxylation of protocollagen in isolated tissues is intermittently interrupted, hydroxylation can occur after complete polypeptides are released from ribosomal complexes. Cartilage from chick embryos was incubated with the iron chelator alpha,alpha'-dipyridyl for 2 hours to inhibit protocollagen hydroxylase, and then the inhibition was reversed by transferring the tissues to medium containing ferrous iron and no alpha,alpha'-dipyridyl. "Pulse labeling" of the tissues during these two periods indicated that both the accumulated protocollagen and the polypeptides synthesized after reversal of the inhibition were hydroxylated at the same rate. Even when no measures are taken to inhibit the hydroxylation of protocollagen, most of the hydroxyproline in collagen is probably synthesized after complete protocollagen polypeptides are released from ribosomes.<Animals, Bone and Bones, cytology, enzymology, metabolism, Carbon Isotopes, Chelating Agents, pharmacology, Chick Embryo, Collagen, biosynthesis, Culture Techniques, Hydroxyproline, biosynthesis, Lysine, metabolism, Mixed Function Oxygenases, metabolism, Peptide Biosynthesis, Peptides, metabolism, Proline, metabolism, Pyridines, pharmacology, Ribosomes, enzymology, metabolism, Tibia

These cystic lesions enlarge progressively and become visible within a few days after birth. When the animal is 2 weeks old, renal size has become three times as large as that of uninjected littermates. Adrenal corticosteroids prolong the duration of nephrogenic activity in the renal cortex. The cysts are blind and represent dilatation of the developing end of the collecting ducts. When the steroid-induced hypokalemia is prevented with repeated potassium chloride injections, renal cystic disease is almost completely prevented.

The concentrations which effectively inhibited the response to phytohemagglutinin were similar to those which maximally inhibit virus replication. The drug inhibited the mitogenic response without affecting the ability of phytohemagglutinin to agglutinate leukocytes.

16048114<Radiative-capture studies of the giant dipole resonance. Gamma-ray yields from capture of protons and alpha-particles give finer details than studies of gamma-ray absorption.<The data on radiative capture through the giant resonance have led to a model in which the capture is pictured as proceeding through a single broad (and therefore short-lived) state that can be called the giant-resonance state. This state is the one formed directly upon capture of a proton, and hence most of the capture radiation is emitted quickly in the direct-interaction mode. Some of the energy that is contained in the giant-resonance state is shared with the more-complicated states of the compound nucleus (that is, with states having many excited nucleons). This sharing, in turn, gives rise to the fine structure that is observed within the giant-resonance envelope. The constant angular distributions that are observed throughout the giant-resonance region support the single-state picture of the giant resonance.<Alpha Particles, Aluminum, Models, Theoretical, Protons, Radiation, Radiometry, Silicon

Thus, both osmotic and diffusional flows can occur by the same mechanism, that is, by diffusion; and there is no need to postulate the existence of water-filled pores in the membranes of this cell.

In the case of auxin, treatment of the apical few millimeters results in strong, permanent coiling throughout the length of the tendril. The speed of the response to CO(2) is comparable to that to tactile stimuli.

16048121<Lithophagic snail from southern British Honduras.<A freshwater gastropod, Pachycheilus glaphyrus, responsible for unusual erosion in limestone has been located in southern British Honduras where it is abundant in streams flowing through areas of karst topography. These snails ingest algae that proliferate in solution grooves formed at the fluctuating air-water interface. Rasping action of the radula results in deepening of these grooves and appears to improve the algal habitat.<Animals, Behavior, Animal, Belize, Calcium Carbonate, Ecology, Eukaryota, Snails, physiology, Tropical Climate
16048122<"Twin meiosis" and other ambivalences in the life cycle of Schizosaccharomyces pombe.<Diploid cells of the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe carrying the mating-type allele h(90) are capable of sporulation and copulation. After copulation karyogamy does not always occur. In this case both nuclei will undergo meioses separately (twin meiosis). Asci with eight haploid spores derive from this event. Diploid cells homozygous for the mating-type alleles h(+) or h(-) do not sporulate. However, their nuclei can perform meiosis when they are in a common cytoplasm with a diploid nucleus of compatible mating type.<Ascomycota, cytology, Cell Nucleus, Conjugation, Genetic, Diploidy, Genotype, Meiosis, Spores
16048123<Boron in plants: a biochemical role.<Boron, as borate, appears to have a role in partitioning metabolism between the glycolytic and pentose-shunt pathways. This effect results from the association of borate with 6-phosphogluconic acid, forming a virtual substrate that inhibits the action of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. In the absence of borate, the inhibition of the enzyme is released, and excess phenolic acids are formed. These acids also associate strongly with borate and thus develop an autocatalytic system for production of excess phenolic acids which cause necrosis of tissue and eventual death of the plant.<Borates, metabolism, Carbon Dioxide, metabolism, Carbon Isotopes, Chemical Phenomena, Chemistry, Physical, Citrates, metabolism, Gluconates, metabolism, Glyoxylates, metabolism, Kinetics, Phenylalanine, metabolism, Phosphogluconate Dehydrogenase, antagonists &amp; inhibitors, Photosynthesis, Plants, metabolism

16048771<Studies on ferrochelatase. The effects of thiols and other factors on the determination of activity.<1. Haems are unstable under aerobic conditions in the presence of thiols, which are used to activate the ferrochelatase enzyme; catalase inhibits this degradation of haem. In addition, thiols interfere with the determination of protohaem as its pyridine haemochromogen derivative. 2. Three ferrochelatase assays are described that minimize interference by these two reactions. Two of these assays involve measurement of porphyrin utilization, one spectrophotometrically and the second spectrofluorimetrically. The third assay measures haem formation by a pyridine haemochromogen technique. Results obtained with these three methods were in close agreement at a GSH concentration of 4mm. 3. The stimulatory effect of GSH on ferrochelatase has been confirmed. The spectrum of the haem formed is dependent on GSH concentration; at high GSH concentrations (20mm) the haem is in the reduced state, but at low concentration (4mm) the spectrum of the product resembles that of an oxidized haemoprotein such as ferrihaemoglobin. 4. The inhibitory effect of oxygen on ferrochelatase activity has been confirmed by spectrophotometric assay of porphyrin disappearance.<Animals, Ascorbic Acid, pharmacology, Catalase, pharmacology, Fluorescence, Glutathione, pharmacology, Heme, antagonists &amp; inhibitors, Lyases, metabolism, Male, Oxygen, pharmacology, Porphyrins, analysis, Rats, Spectrophotometry
16048772<Active cation transport in dog spermatozoa.<1. When dog semen is stored at 5 degrees for 24hr., K(+) is lost from the spermatozoa and Na(+) accumulates in the cells. 2. If at the end of the cold-storage period the semen is incubated at 37 degrees in the presence of added glucose there is a rapid uptake of K(+) and extrusion of Na(+) from the spermatozoa, the intracellular K(+) reaching a maximum within 30min. 3. When the semen is incubated at 20 degrees after cold storage there is an uptake of K(+) by the spermatozoa over 3hr. but no change in intracellular Na(+) concentration. 4. The extrusion of Na(+) and uptake of K(+) by dog spermatozoa has been shown to be inhibited by fluoride, iodoacetate, 2,4-dinitrophenol, and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide. 5. Uptake of K(+) is inhibited by ouabain and half maximum inhibition is obtained with a concentration of 50mmum. There is a slight stimulation of K(+) uptake in the presence of ouabain at about 0.3% of the concentration required for half maximum inhibition.<Animals, Antimetabolites, pharmacology, Biological Transport, Active, Calcium, metabolism, Dogs, Glucose, pharmacology, Magnesium, metabolism, Male, Potassium, metabolism, Semen, metabolism, Sodium, metabolism, Spermatozoa, metabolism, Temperature
16048776<Lipid composition of human serum lipoproteins.<1. The lipid compositions of the low-density lipoproteins, the high-density lipoproteins and the ultracentrifugal residue of human serum are presented, with emphasis on certain lipoprotein classes and lipid components not previously described. 2. Except for the lipoproteins with the lowest and highest densities, there is a trend for stepwise successive increase or, respectively, decrease in the relative amounts of the main constituents of lipoproteins. 3. High-density lipoprotein-2 and high-density lipoprotein-3 have different amounts of certain lipids; high-density lipoprotein-2 has relatively more free cholesterol and sphingomyelin; high-density lipoprotein-3 has more free fatty acids, diglycerides and ceramide monohexosides. 4. All the lipoproteins contain hydrocarbons of the alkane series. The greatest amount, which averages 4.4% of total lipid extracted, is in the ultracentrifugal residue; n-alkanes comprise 18-50% of the hydrocarbons. 5. All the lipoproteins contain ceramide monohexosides. The highest relative contents of these glycolipids are in high-density lipoprotein-3 and in the ultracentrifugal residue. 6. The ultracentrifugal residue contains 55% of the total quantity of free fatty acids present in serum. The remaining free fatty acids are distributed among the other lipoprotein classes. 7. The choline-containing phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin) comprise about 90% of the phospholipids in all the lipoprotein classes except the low-density lipoprotein-2, which contains about 80% of these phospholipids. 8. The presence of a large amount of lysophosphatidylcholine in the ultracentrifugal residue and the successive decrease of sphingomyelin from the low-density lipoprotein-1 to the ultracentrifugal residue was confirmed. 9. The low-density lipoprotein-2 and the ultracentrifugal residue are characterized by relatively high contents of the lower glycerides.<Adult, Alkanes, analysis, Chromatography, Chromatography, Gas, Chromatography, Thin Layer, Fasting, Female, Humans, Lipids, analysis, Lipoproteins, blood, Ultracentrifugation
16048778<Partial characterization of the sialic acid-free forms of alpha-1-acid glycoprotein from human plasma.<Some of the properties of sialic acid-free alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein prepared by mild acid hydrolysis (pH1.6 at 80 degrees for 1hr.) were compared with those of neuraminidasetreated alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein. Chemically, the former contained less fucose (15%) and amide (2%) residues. Physicochemically, it had undergone certain changes primarily pertaining to the secondary structure, so that the specific optical rotation was more negative than that of the latter. A further expression of this change is probably the difference in the pH range of the resolution into two bands on electrophoresis. The resolution of the glycoprotein prepared by mild acid hydrolysis seems to be extended to more acidic pH values both by starch-gel and free moving-boundary electrophoresis. On ultracentrifugation both preparations appeared homogeneous and sedimented with a rate of 3s. Removal of sialyl residues at different pH values, in the range 1-7, showed that 2moles of sialic acid/mole of protein are very strongly bound. The two variants of alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein were isolated from pooled sialic acid-free alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein by preparative starch-gel electrophoresis and from selected blood of normal adults by fractionation by solubility and chromatography. Ultracentrifugal and starch-gel electrophoretic analyses at pH5, with incubation times of 1 or 24hr., demonstrated that no dissociation-association equilibrium (constant sedimentation coefficient and molecular weight) or isomerization (constant apparent electrophoretic mobilities) exist between the two variants. Therefore these variants are not sub-units of native alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein but represent modifications of naturally occurring proteins. Further, it was shown that the difference in the electrophoretic mobilities between the two variants was not due to any difference in amide content. Immunochemically, the two variants share the same determinants.<Acids, pharmacology, Amides, analysis, Electrophoresis, Glycoproteins, blood, Humans, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Immunoelectrophoresis, Neuraminic Acids, blood, Neuraminidase, pharmacology, Ultracentrifugation
16048779<Specificity and stereospecificity of alpha-chymotrypsin.<1. The optically pure p-nitrophenyl esters of the d and l enantiomers of N-acetyl-tryptophan, N-acetylphenylalanine and N-acetyl-leucine, and the p-nitrophenyl ester of N-acetylglycine, have been prepared. 2. These materials are all substrates of alpha-chymotrypsin, and the rates of deacylation of the corresponding acyl-alpha-chymotrypsins have been determined. 3. As the size of the amino acid side chain increases, the l series deacylate progressively faster than the N-acetylglycyl-enzyme, and the d series progressively more slowly. 4. The results are interpreted in terms of a three-locus model of the enzyme's active site, which accounts for the interrelationship between substrate specificity and stereospecificity observed. 5. The concepts of negative specificity and of specificity saturation are introduced.<Binding Sites, Chemical Phenomena, Chemistry, Chymotrypsin, metabolism, Glycine, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Kinetics, Leucine, Models, Chemical, Nitrophenols, chemical synthesis, Phenylalanine, Tryptophan
16048780<Effects of isoniazid on the composition of mycobacteria, with particular reference to soluble carbohydrates and related substances.<1. When growing Mycobacterium tuberculosis BCG was exposed to 0.5-10mug. of isoniazid/ml. there was intracellular accumulation of soluble carbohydrate, combined phosphate and substances absorbing at 260mmu. Yellow pigments were formed when modified Sauton medium was used, but not with Proskauer &amp; Beck medium. These processes were apparent after 1hr. but were more marked after about 6hr. These effects were not found with an isoniazid-resistant strain. 2. After 6hr. exposure of the sensitive strain to 10mug./ml. there was little change in the amounts (per g. of insoluble nitrogen) of total lipid, glycolipid, RNA, DNA or of carbohydrate in the nucleic acid fractions. 3. The major accumulation was of alphaalpha'-trehalose. There was also accumulation of glucose 6-phosphate, glucose 1-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, trehalose 6-phosphate (tentatively identified), a polysaccharide containing only glucose, and an oligosaccharide containing glucose and glucose 6-phosphate, but not of glycerol and glycerol 3-phosphate. The u.v.-absorbing materials appeared to be nucleotide sugar derivatives. 4. In Mycobacterium smegmatis a similar accumulation of trehalose occurred on exposure to isoniazid, but there was little accumulation of other compounds. 5. No evidence could be found that isoniazid specifically affected the oxidation of glycerol or glycerol 3-phosphate. 6. It is suggested that the primary action of isoniazid on mycobacteria may be partial inhibition of a reaction in some central area of metabolism, such as glycolysis.<Carbohydrate Metabolism, Drug Resistance, Microbial, Isoniazid, pharmacology, Mycobacterium, drug effects, Pigments, Biological, biosynthesis, Solubility, Spectrophotometry
16048781<The effect of pretreatment with adrenal-protecting compounds on the metabolism of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene and related compounds by rat-liver homogenates.<1. 7,12-Dimethylbenz[a]anthracene is converted by rat-liver homogenates into products with the properties of the 7- and 12-hydroxymethyl derivatives, the 7,12-dihydroxymethyl derivative, the related carboxylic acids and ring-hydroxylated products such as the 8,9-dihydro-8,9-dihydroxy derivative and phenols. Ring-hydroxylated products and products arising from the further oxidation of the hydroxymethyl groups were formed when the hydroxymethyl derivatives were themselves incubated with rat-liver homogenates. 2. Pretreatment of the animal with 3-methylcholanthrene or with Sudan III, which can protect rat adrenal glands from damage by 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene or by its 7-hydroxymethyl derivative, led to an increased rate of metabolism of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene and its hydroxymethyl derivatives. The metabolic routes mainly affected were those involving the formation of ring-hydroxylated products. 3. Pretreatment with phenobarbitone led to a small increase in the rate of metabolism of the hydrocarbon and of its hydroxymethyl derivatives, but the increase appeared mainly to involve increased metabolism of the methyl and hydroxymethyl groups. 4. Pretreatment with metyrapone increased the rate of metabolism of the hydrocarbon mainly by increasing the amounts of products resulting from hydroxylation of the methyl groups: small increases in the amounts of ring-hydroxylated products were also produced. 8. Of a number of hydrocarbons and of derivatives of 3-methylcholanthrene tested as enzyme inducers, 3-methylcholanthrene itself was the most effective.<Adrenal Glands, drug effects, Animals, Benz(a)Anthracenes, metabolism, Chromatography, Thin Layer, Drug Antagonism, Enzyme Induction, Fluorescence, Injections, Intraperitoneal, Liver, metabolism, Male, Methylcholanthrene, pharmacology, Metyrapone, pharmacology, Rats, Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet Rays
16048782<Fractionation of a hyaluronic acid preparation in a density gradient. The isolation and identification of a chondroitin sulphate.<1. Following the suggestion of Nichol, Ogston &amp; Preston (1967) that hyaluronic acid, prepared by filtration from ox synovial fluid, contains a component of high density, such material has been detected and isolated by equilibrium sedimentation in a density gradient of caesium chloride. 2. This material (fraction III) has been characterized as a chondroitin sulphate-protein complex of average molecular weight about 250000. Its amino acid pattern is characteristic of such complexes present in cartilage. It contains a proportion of glucosamine (as well as galactosamine); this is not due to contamination with hyaluronic acid. 3. Preliminary findings on fraction I (low density) and fraction II (intermediate density) suggest that these consist chiefly of protein and hyaluronic acid respectively.<Amino Acids, analysis, Animals, Cattle, Centrifugation, Density Gradient, Chondroitin, analysis, Filtration, Hyaluronic Acid, analysis, Infrared Rays, Molecular Weight, Spectrum Analysis, Sulfates, analysis, Synovial Fluid, analysis
16048783<Concentrations of glycerides and phospholipids in rat heart and gastrocnemius muscles. Effects of alloxan-diabetes and perfusion.<1. Methods are described for the extraction of lipid and assay of mono-, di- and tri-glyceride glycerol and phospholipid phosphorus in rat heart and gastrocnemius muscles. 2. In hearts from normal animals, concentrations found were: monoglyceride, 0.6; diglyceride, 0.1; triglyceride, 12.6mumoles of glyceride glycerol/g. of dry muscle; phospholipid, 171mug.atoms of phospholipid phosphorus/g. of dry muscle. Concentrations of glycerides in gastrocnemius muscle were similar to heart muscle but those of phospholipids were lower (64mug.atoms of phospholipid phosphorus/g. of dry muscle). 3. Alloxan-diabetes increased the concentration of triglyceride in the muscles twofold. This increase was shown to be dependent in the heart on the availability of growth hormone and cortisol but not on the availability of dietary lipid. Total glyceride in the heart was increased after 48 and 72hr. starvation but not after 96hr. Changes in glyceride concentration seen in starvation and diabetes were not associated with significant changes in phospholipid concentration. It is suggested that mobilization of free fatty acids in diabetes leads to the synthesis of additional glyceride in muscle. 4. The possible contribution of glyceride fatty acid in the heart to respiration during perfusion has been calculated from the net loss of glyceride during perfusion, and also from the relative rates of lipolysis and esterification and compared with oxidation of fatty acid required for the balance of oxygen consumption (oxygen not utilized in the oxidation of glucose or glycogen glucose). In the normal or diabetic heart perfused with glucose and insulin the breakdown of glyceride can account for the balance of oxygen consumption. In the normal heart perfused without substrate the balance of oxygen consumption is not entirely accounted for by the breakdown of glyceride.<Animals, Carbon Isotopes, Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental, metabolism, Dietary Fats, metabolism, Glucose, pharmacology, Glycerides, metabolism, Growth Substances, pharmacology, Hydrocortisone, pharmacology, Hypophysectomy, Insulin, pharmacology, Male, Muscles, metabolism, Myocardium, metabolism, Oxygen Consumption, Perfusion, Phospholipids, metabolism, Rats, Starvation
16048784<Measurement of flow of carbon atoms from glucose and glycogen glucose to glyceride glycerol and glycerol in rat heart and epididymal adipose tissue. Effects of insulin, adrenaline and alloxan-diabetes.<1. Flow of carbon atoms from glucose and glycogen glucose to glyceride glycerol, glyceride fatty acids and glycerol was calculated in the perfused rat heart and incubated epididymal adipose tissue from the incorporation of (14)C from [U-(14)C]-glucose (into glyceride glycerol, glyceride fatty acids and glycerol in the medium), and from measurements of the specific activity of l-glycerol 3-phosphate, and the effects of insulin, adrenaline and alloxan-diabetes were studied. Measurements were also made of the uptake of glucose and the outputs of lactate, pyruvate and glycerol. 2. New methods are described for the measurement of radioactivity in small amounts of metabolites (glycerol, glucose 6-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate and l-glycerol 3-phosphate) in which use has been made of alterations in charge induced by enzymic conversions to effect resolution by ion-exchange chromatography. 3. In hearts the specific activity of l-glycerol 3-phosphate was less than that of glucose in the medium but similar to that of lactate released during perfusion. Because repeated measurements of the specific activity of l-glycerol 3-phosphate was impracticable, the specific activity of lactate has been used as an indirect measurement of glycerol phosphate specific activity. 4. In fat pads, specific activity of lactate was the same as that of glucose in the medium and thus the specific activity of l-glycerol 3-phosphate was taken to be the same as that of medium glucose. 5. In hearts from alloxan-diabetic rats, despite decreased glucose uptake and l-glycerol 3-phosphate concentration, flow of carbon atoms through l-glycerol 3-phosphate to glyceride glycerol was increased about threefold. 6. In fat pads, flow of carbon atoms through l-glycerol 3-phosphate to glyceride glycerol was increased by insulin (twofold), by adrenaline in the presence of insulin (fivefold) and by diabetes in pads incubated with insulin (1.5-fold). These increases could not be correlated either with increases in glucose uptake, which was unchanged by adrenaline and decreased in diabetes, or with the concentration of l-glycerol 3-phosphate, which was decreased by adrenaline and unchanged in diabetes. 7. These results are discussed in relation to the control of glyceride synthesis in heart and adipose tissue and to the regulation of glyceride fatty acid oxidation in the perfused rat heart.<Adipose Tissue, metabolism, Animals, Carbon Isotopes, Chromatography, Ion Exchange, Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental, metabolism, Epididymis, metabolism, Epinephrine, pharmacology, Glucose, metabolism, Glycerides, biosynthesis, Insulin, pharmacology, Lactates, metabolism, Male, Myocardium, metabolism, Perfusion, Rats, Spectrophotometry
16048785<Effect of administration of the carcinogen dimethylnitrosamine on urinary 7-methylguanine.<1. Evidence is presented for the excretion of 7-methylguanine in normal rat urine at a rate of approx. 65mug./day. Experiments with animals in which the nucleic acids had been prelabelled by treatment of the neonatal rats with [(14)C]-formate gave evidence that the methylated base originated in the nucleic acids of the rat. 2. Injection of [(14)C]dimethylnitrosamine leads to an increased excretion of 7-methylguanine, and the base becomes labelled in the methyl group. The disappearance of labelled 7-methylguanine formed in nucleic acids of rats treated with the carcinogen therefore does not take place by an N-demethylation reaction, but by liberation of the intact methylated base.<Alkylation, Animals, Animals, Newborn, metabolism, Carbon Isotopes, Carcinogens, pharmacology, Chromatography, Ion Exchange, Chromatography, Paper, Formates, metabolism, Guanine, urine, Nitrosamines, pharmacology, Nucleic Acids, metabolism, Rats
16048786<Metabolism of propionate by sheep liver. Pathway of propionate metabolism in aged homogenate and mitochondria.<Experiments were conducted with aged nuclear-free homogenate of sheep liver and aged mitochondria in an attempt to measure both the extent of oxidation of propionate and the distribution of label from [2-(14)C]propionate in the products. With nuclear-free homogenate, propionate was 44% oxidized with the accumulation of succinate, fumarate, malate and some citrate. Recovery of (14)C in these intermediates and respiratory carbon dioxide was only 33%, but additional label was detected in endogenous glutamate and aspartate. With washed mitochondria 30% oxidation of metabolized propionate occurred, and proportionately more citrate and malate accumulated. Recovery of (14)C in dicarboxylic acids, citrate, alpha-oxoglutarate, glutamate, aspartate and respiratory carbon dioxide was 91%. The specific activities of the products and the distribution of label in the carbon atoms of the dicarboxylic acids were consistent with the operation solely of the methylmalonate pathway together with limited oxidation of the succinate formed by the tricarboxylic acid cycle via pyruvate. In a final experiment with mitochondria the label consumed from [2-(14)C]propionate was entirely recovered in the intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, glutamate, aspartate, methylmalonate and respiratory carbon dioxide.<Aging, Animals, Carbon Isotopes, Citric Acid Cycle, Dicarboxylic Acids, analysis, Female, Liver, metabolism, Malonates, metabolism, Mitochondria, metabolism, Oxygen Consumption, Propionates, metabolism, Sheep
16048787<Metabolism of propionate by sheep-liver mitochondria. Effects of alpha-oxoglutarate, adenosine triphosphate, sodium chloride and potassium chloride.<1. A study has been made of the effects of ATP and alpha-oxoglutarate on the rate of metabolism of propionate by whole mitochondria from sheep liver, and by mitochondria disrupted with ultrasonic energy or by freezing and thawing. Whole mitochondria metabolized propionate aerobically; the rate was increased and stabilized by 0.5mm-ATP, and increased at least a further 50% by 1.67mm-alpha-oxoglutarate. 2. Anaerobically, externally added ATP at high concentrations permitted slow consumption of propionate. 3. In the presence of 1.3mm-ATP, but in the absence of alpha-oxoglutarate, there was no significant lag phase in the removal of propionate by whole mitochondria, and the rate declined at concentrations below 2mm. In the additional presence of 1.67mm-alpha-oxoglutarate or -glutamate, propionate was removed at linear rates until the residual propionate concentration was about 0.1mm. 4. Maximum rates of metabolism of propionate by whole mitochondria with 1.3mm-ATP occurred with alkali-metal chloride concentrations of 65-95mm and with K(+)/Na(+) ratios 5-10, both in the presence and absence of alpha-oxoglutarate. 5. With disrupted mitochondria stimulatory effects of alpha-oxoglutarate were obtained only aerobically, only with propionate and not propionyl-CoA as substrate, and only when sufficient mitochondrial structure remained to permit unsupplemented metabolism of propionate to occur. 6. In the presence of ATP and CoA, disrupted mitochondria fixed [2-(14)C]propionate at a rate adequate to explain the rate with whole mitochondria stimulated with ATP and alpha-oxoglutarate. 7. With both whole and partially disrupted mitochondria in the absence of ATP, the rate of metabolism of propionate was inhibited by about 80% by 3.3mm-AMP. The inhibition was partly overcome by alpha-oxoglutarate plus CoA. 8. It is concluded that the ultimate effect of alpha-oxoglutarate was to increase the rate of supply of ATP within the mitochondria. Reasons are given why it is premature to conclude that the extra ATP arose entirely from the oxidation of alpha-oxoglutarate itself.<Adenosine Triphosphate, pharmacology, Animals, Carbon Isotopes, Female, Freezing, Glutarates, pharmacology, Kinetics, Liver, metabolism, Mitochondria, metabolism, Oxalates, pharmacology, Potassium Chloride, pharmacology, Propionates, metabolism, Pyruvates, metabolism, Sheep, Sodium Chloride, pharmacology, Ultrasonics
16048788<Metabolism of propionate by sheep-liver mitochondria. Evidence for rate control by a specific succinate oxidase.<1. Metabolism of propionate by sheep-liver mitochondria was stimulated catalytically by alpha-oxoglutarate, pyruvate, citrate and isocitrate. Succinate was stimulatory at higher concentrations, but fumarate and malate were inert. These effects were all independent of the presence of ATP, succinate being less effective when ATP was present. 2. Compared with the metabolism of added succinate, propionate metabolism was resistant to malonate inhibition, but only in the presence of added ATP. In the absence of ATP propionate metabolism was more sensitive to malonate inhibition than was the metabolism of succinate. 3. In the absence of malonate, and at malonate concentrations in the range 5-100mm, alpha-oxoglutarate increased the rate of fixation of [2-(14)C]propionate by about 50% without altering the nature of the fixation products. 4. Metabolism of [1-(14)C]-propionate in the presence of 50mm-malonate was accompanied by accumulation of about half the propionate consumed as succinate. When alpha-oxoglutarate was present in addition part of the alpha-oxoglutarate was metabolized and the rate of propionate consumption was increased. The total succinate that accumulated corresponded to the alpha-oxoglutarate consumed plus about half the propionate metabolized. 5. When [1-(14)C]propionate was metabolized in the absence of malonate about 70% of the generated succinate was oxidized to fumarate or beyond. The addition of malonate decreased the rate of propionate metabolism, and decreased to about half the fraction of generated succinate oxidized. 6. When propionate and 10mm-succinate were metabolized together, the total oxidation of succinate was greater than that with 10mm-succinate alone. The increment in succinate oxidation corresponded to about half the propionate metabolized in the presence or absence of malonate or ATP. 7. It is suggested that the metabolism of propionate is specifically limited by the rate of oxidation of the generated succinate, and that the succinate oxidase concerned is distinct from that responsible for the oxidation of added succinate. 8. The results are discussed in terms of the mode of action of certain stimulants and inhibitors of propionate metabolism. It is suggested that many of these act by stimulation or inhibition of the specific succinate oxidase that limits propionate metabolism.<Adenosine Triphosphate, pharmacology, Animals, Carbon Isotopes, Citric Acid Cycle, Female, Liver, metabolism, Malonates, pharmacology, Mitochondria, metabolism, Propionates, metabolism, Sheep, Statistics as Topic, Succinate Dehydrogenase, pharmacology
16048789<Reduction of ribonuclease by glutathione at elevated temperatures: the molecular mechanism.<1. The mechanism of the reaction between ribonuclease and GSH at elevated temperatures has been studied by using N-(4-dimethylamino-3,5-dinitrophenyl)-maleimide to label the reduced ribonuclease. 2. After incubation for 2hr. at 35 degrees , enzymically active ribonuclease was recovered; at 50.8 degrees half of the initial ribonuclease was recovered as enzymically active ribonuclease and half as reduced labelled ribonuclease; at 55 degrees all of the initial ribonuclease was recovered in the labelled form. 3. It was inferred that the rate-limiting step was the reduction of the first disulphide bond in any one molecule. This was followed by rapid reduction of the other bonds in the same molecule.<Amino Acids, analysis, Glutathione, metabolism, Maleates, pharmacology, Ribonucleases, metabolism, Sulfides, metabolism, Temperature
16048790<Interrelationships between fatty acid biosynthesis and acyl-lipid synthesis in Chlorella vulgaris.<1. Fatty acid synthesis from [2-(14)C]acetate by Chlorella vulgaris cells grown and incubated in the dark is limited almost entirely to the production of saturated and monoenoic acids. 2. In light-incubated cells, both saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids are rapidly synthesized. 3. Two groups of lipids can be distinguished in both dark- and light-incubated cells. The first group, consisting of phosphatidyl-glycerol, monogalactosyl diglyceride, lecithin and neutral glyceride, has a very high turnover rate for certain fatty acids. The second group, consisting of digalactosyl diglyceride, sulpholipid, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylinositol, has a slow turnover of fatty acids. 4. The lipids with rapid fatty acid turnover may be involved in the sequences of saturated and unsaturated fatty acid synthesis. A classification of lipids is made on the basis of their suggested functions.<Acetates, metabolism, Carbon Isotopes, Chloroplasts, metabolism, Eukaryota, Fatty Acids, biosynthesis, Light, Lipids, analysis, classification
16048791<Concentrations of free glucogenic amino acids in livers of rats subjected to various metabolic stresses.<1. The concentrations of alanine, aspartate, glutamate, glutamine and serine plus threonine have been measured by enzymic methods in ;quick-frozen' livers from normal, starved, alloxan-diabetic and phlorrhizin-treated rats. 2. The hepatic concentrations of alanine and serine plus threonine were decreased in rats starved for 48hr. Treatment of these rats with phlorrhizin resulted in a rapid fall (within 2(1/2)hr.) in the concentrations of all the glucogenic amino acids except serine plus threonine, which increased. The pattern for alloxan-diabetic rats was similar to that for phlorrhizin-treated animals, except that here serine plus threonine also decreased in concentration. 3. The effects of anoxia on the hepatic concentrations of the glucogenic amino acids are reported. 4. Inhibition of glutamate-pyruvate transaminase in vivo by l-cycloserine resulted in the accumulation of alanine in situations involving high rates of gluconeogenesis from endogenous amino acids. 5. Measurements of the concentrations of the reactants of the glutamate-pyruvate transaminase and glutamate-oxoglutarate transaminase systems in various metabolic states suggest that they are both at or near equilibrium in rat liver. 6. New enzymic methods are described for the determination of serine plus threonine and alanine.<Alanine, analysis, Amino Acids, analysis, Animals, Aspartic Acid, analysis, Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental, metabolism, Gluconeogenesis, Glutamates, analysis, Glutamine, analysis, Hypoxia, metabolism, Insulin, pharmacology, Liver, metabolism, Male, Phlorhizin, pharmacology, Rats, Serine, analysis, Starvation, metabolism, Threonine, analysis, Transaminases, metabolism
16048792<pH-dependence of carnitine acetyltransferase activity.<1. The pH-dependence of the kinetic constants of the carnitine acetyltransferase reaction has been investigated with the enzyme from pigeon breast muscle. 2. Michaelis constants for (-)-carnitine and acetyl-(-)-carnitine vary in a similar fashion in the pH range 6.0-9.0. A single ionizing group on the enzyme with an apparent pK7.2 is required in the basic form for binding of these substrates. 3. Binding of CoASH or acetyl-CoA raises the apparent pK of an ionizing group on the enzyme from 7.85 to 8.25. This group is probably not directly involved in forming the enzyme-substrate complex, but its microscopic environment is presumably altered. Another group in either the substrate or the free enzyme, with an apparent pK6.4, is needed in the basic form for optimum binding of CoA substrates. 4. This last group has been unequivocally identified as the 3'-phosphate of CoA, by showing that the K(m) of carnitine acetyltransferase for the substrate acetyl-3'-dephospho-CoA is independent of pH in the range 6.0-7.8. 5. V'(max.), the maximum velocity of the catalysed reaction between acetyl-CoA and (-)-carnitine, is constant between pH6.0 and 8.8. 6. The significance of these results in terms of a previously postulated reaction scheme for this enzyme is discussed.<Acyltransferases, metabolism, Animals, Binding Sites, Carnitine, metabolism, Coenzyme A, Columbidae, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Kinetics, Muscles, enzymology
16048793<Effects of fatty acids, ketone bodies, lactate and pyruvate on glucose utilization by guinea-pig cerebral cortex slices.<1. Starvation did not affect the rates of glucose utilization or lactate formation by guinea-pig cerebral cortex slices. 2. Palmitate (1mm), butyrate (5mm) or acetoacetate (5mm) did not affect glucose utilization or lactate formation by cerebral cortex slices from guinea pigs starved for 48hr. 3. dl-beta-Hydroxybutyrate (10mm) increased the formation of lactate without affecting glucose utilization by cerebral cortex slices from guinea pigs starved for 48hr. This implies that beta-hydroxybutyrate decreased the rate of glucose oxidation. 4. Metabolism of added ketone bodies can account for 20-40% of observed rates of oxygen consumption. 5. Lactate or pyruvate (5mm) decreased the rates of glucose utilization by guinea-pig cerebral cortex slices.<Acetoacetates, pharmacology, Animals, Butyrates, pharmacology, Cerebral Cortex, drug effects, Fatty Acids, pharmacology, Female, Glucose, metabolism, Guinea Pigs, Ketone Bodies, pharmacology, Lactates, pharmacology, Male, Oxygen Consumption, instrumentation, Palmitic Acids, pharmacology, Pyruvates, pharmacology, Starvation, metabolism

16048795<Lipids of the adrenal medulla. Lysolecithin, a characteristic constituent of chromaffin granules.<1. The lipid composition of microsomes, mitochondria and chromaffin granules, obtained from homogenates of bovine adrenal medulla, has been investigated. 2. The three types of particle showed characteristic differences of phospholipid and cholesterol content. The lipid composition of microsomes and mitochondria resembled that of corresponding particles from other tissues. The chromaffin granules contained 19% of the cholesterol and 14% of the phospholipids of the low-speed supernatant. 3. Thin-layer chromatography indicated the presence of these phospholipids in extracts from each particle: lecithin, lysolecithin, phosphatidylethanolamine (partly plasmalogen), phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol and sphingomyelin. 4. On quantitative analysis of the phospholipids, chromaffin granules were found to contain a high concentration of lysolecithin (17% of the lipid phosphorus). Mitochondria and microsomes, on the other hand, contained very little lysolecithin (less than 2% of the lipid phosphorus).<Adrenal Medulla, analysis, Animals, Cattle, Cholesterol, analysis, Chromaffin System, analysis, Chromatography, Thin Layer, Lipids, analysis, Lysophosphatidylcholines, analysis, Microsomes, analysis, Mitochondria, analysis, Phospholipids, analysis
16048796<Studies on the biosynthesis of 16-dehydro steroids. The metabolism of [4-14C]pregnenolone by boar adrenal and testis tissue in vitro.<1. The metabolism of [4-(14)C]pregnenolone in vitro by boar adrenocortical and testis tissue has been studied. 2. Boar testis tissue formed three labelled Delta(16)-steroids, 5alpha-androst-16-en-3alpha-ol, 5alpha-androst-16-en-3beta-ol and androsta-4,16-dien-3-one. In adrenal tissue very much smaller yields of the same metabolites were obtained. 3. Both tissues produced labelled progesterone, androst-4-ene-3,17-dione and testosterone in varying quantities. The amount of progesterone was about 120 times greater in the adrenal tissue. In testis tissue dehydroepiandrosterone was found only in small quantity. 4. A pathway is suggested for the biosynthesis of Delta(16)-steroids from pregnenolone in boar testis tissue. The possibility that progesterone may be an intermediate is discussed.<Adrenal Glands, metabolism, Animals, Carbon Isotopes, Chromatography, Chromatography, Gas, In Vitro Techniques, Male, Pregnenolone, metabolism, Steroids, biosynthesis, Swine, Testis, metabolism
16048797<The formation of ornithine from proline in animal tissues.<1. Homogenates of liver or kidney from rat, mouse, dog and guinea pig formed ornithine from proline but not from glutamate. Rat kidney was most active in this reaction and was used for further studies. 2. The overall reaction was found to be catalysed by proline oxidase to yield glutamic gamma-semialdehyde, followed by transamination of this product with glutamate as catalysed by ornithine-keto acid aminotransferase. 3. The unfavourable equilibrium of the ornithine-keto acid aminotransferase reaction was overcome chiefly by glutamate dehydrogenase in the tissue, which removed the alpha-oxoglutarate produced, by reduction with endogenous ammonia and NADH. 4. Aspartate aminotransferase in these preparations also aided in the removal of alpha-oxoglutarate. In this case the overall reaction was driven also by the rapid decarboxylation of oxaloacetate. 5. No evidence could be found for a pathway of ornithine synthesis involving acylated intermediates as has been observed in some micro-organisms. 6. The rate of ornithine synthesis in homogenates of several rat tissues paralleled the activity of ornithine-keto acid aminotransferase in these tissues, indicating that this enzyme was rate-determining for the synthesis. 7. The possible influence of these reactions on urea synthesis is discussed.<Alanine Transaminase, analysis, Animals, Aspartate Aminotransferases, analysis, Aspartic Acid, metabolism, Carbon Isotopes, Dogs, Electrophoresis, Glutamates, metabolism, Guinea Pigs, In Vitro Techniques, Kidney, metabolism, Kinetics, Liver, metabolism, Mice, Ornithine, biosynthesis, Proline, metabolism, Rats, Spectrophotometry
16048798<The fate of[14C]thalidomide in the pregnant rabbit.<1. The fate of [(14)C]thalidomide orally administered to pregnant rabbits at the beginning of the sensitive phase of pregnancy has been studied. 2. After the oral administration of [(14)C]thalidomide on the 192nd hour of pregnancy about 68% of the radioactivity appears in the urine and 22% in the faeces. 3. The urinary (14)C is made up as follows (% of dose): thalidomide (2); alpha-(o-carboxybenzamido)glutarimide (16); 2- and 4-phthalimidoglutaramic acids (11); 2-phthalimidoglutaric acid (0.2); 2- and 4-(o-carboxybenzamido)glutaramic acids and 2-(o-carboxybenzamido)-glutaric acid (29). 4. The plasma (14)C concentration is maximal at 12hr. after dosing and the radioactivity persists for more than 58hr. At 4hr. the main compound in the plasma is thalidomide, but its concentration steadily declines while the concentration of its hydrolysis products increases. 5. At 12, 24 and 58hr. after dosing radioactivity is present in the embryo and the maternal tissues examined. The (14)C concentration in the embryo is at nearly all times higher than that in the plasma, brain, skeletal muscle and fat but lower than that in the liver and kidney. 6. At 4hr. after dosing the mother on the tenth day of pregnancy the specific activities of the embryo and the yolk-sac fluid are similar. 7. Thalidomide is found in the embryo together with seven of its hydrolysis products for more than 24hr. after dosing. The accumulation of radioactivity in the embryo is due to retention of the polar hydrolysis products.<Adipose Tissue, analysis, Animals, Blood Chemical Analysis, Brain Chemistry, Carbon Isotopes, Embryo, Mammalian, analysis, Feces, analysis, Female, Kidney, analysis, Liver, analysis, Muscles, analysis, Pregnancy, Pregnancy, Animal, Rabbits, Thalidomide, metabolism, Urine, analysis
16048799<The fate of the hydrolysis products of thalidomide in the pregnant rabbit.<1. The fate in the pregnant New Zealand White rabbit of oral doses of four (14)C-labelled hydrolysis products of thalidomide, namely alpha-(o-carboxybenzamido)-glutarimide, 2-phthalimidoglutaramic acid, 2-phthalimidoglutaric acid and 2-(o-carboxybenzamido)glutaramic acid, administered on the 192nd hour of pregnancy has been studied. 2. About 60-95% of the administered (14)C of each compound appears in the urine in 58hr. and the remainder is found in the faeces and in the gut and its contents. 3. Radioactivity is present in the plasma, liver, kidney, brain, muscle, fat and embryo. 4. The (14)C-labelled substances in the plasma and embryo consist of the unchanged compounds and their further hydrolysis products. 5. Since the above four thalidomide hydrolysis products are found in the rabbit conceptus together with their further hydrolysis products after their oral administration to the pregnant rabbit, it appears that the teratogenic activity of thalidomide is due to the compound itself rather than to one or more of its hydrolysis products.<Adipose Tissue, analysis, Animals, Blood Chemical Analysis, Brain Chemistry, Carbon Isotopes, Digestive System, analysis, Embryo, Mammalian, analysis, Feces, analysis, Female, Glutarates, metabolism, Kidney, analysis, Liver, analysis, Muscles, analysis, Pregnancy, Pregnancy, Animal, Rabbits, Thalidomide, metabolism, Urine, analysis

16048801<Acid-base titration across the membrane system of rat-liver mitochondria. Catalysis by uncouplers.<1. Pulsed acid-base titrations of suspensions of rat-liver mitochondria under anaerobic equilibrium conditions show fast and slow titration processes. 2. The fast process is the titration of the outer aqueous phase of the mitochondria, which is continuous with the suspension medium, and the slow process can be identified with the titration of the inner aqueous phase of the mitochondria, which is separated from the outer aqueous phase by the non-aqueous osmotic barrier or M phase of the cristae membrane system. 3. The buffering power of the outer and inner phases have been separately measured over a range of pH values. 4. The rate of titration of the inner aqueous phase under a known protonmotive force across the M phase has been characterized by an effective proton conductance coefficient, which, near pH7 and at 25 degrees , is only 0.45mumho/cm.(2) of the M-phase membrane. 5. The low effective proton conductance of the M phase will account quantitatively for the observed respiratory control in state 4, assuming that oxidoreduction and phosphorylation are coupled by a circulating proton current as required by the chemi-osmotic hypothesis. 6. The addition of 2,4-dinitrophenol (or carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone) at normal uncoupling concentrations causes a large increase in the effective proton conductance of the M phase of the cristae membrane. 7. The increase of the effective proton conductance of the M phase by 2,4-dinitrophenol (or carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone) will account quantitatively for the short-circuiting effect of the uncoupling agent on the proton current and for the observed rise of the rate of respiration to that characteristic of state 3 or higher.<Animals, Dinitrophenols, pharmacology, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Hypoxia, In Vitro Techniques, Kinetics, Liver, metabolism, Male, Membrane Potentials, Mitochondria, metabolism, Models, Biological, Oxidative Phosphorylation, Permeability, Rats
16048802<A spectrophotometric method for the direct determination of cysteine in the presence of other naturally occurring amino acids.<1. An acid ninhydrin reagent was found to react specifically in forming a pink product (E(max.) 560mmu) with cysteine. 2. The method was highly sensitive for the determination of cysteine (in 28.0x10(3)). Homocysteine, glutathione, proline, ornithine and other naturally occurring amino acids tested did not give a similar reaction. 3. The reaction product was stable for at least 3-4hr. at room temperature and the extinction was proportional to the concentration in the range 0.05-0.5mumole of cysteine. 4. The acid ninhydrin reagent also gave yellow products (E(max.) 370-404mmu) with tryptophan, 5-hydroxytryptophan, 5-hydroxytryptamine and indol-3-ylacetic acid. 5. The method was applied for the determination of cysteine in perchloric acid extracts of rat brain, liver and blood.<Amino Acids, analysis, Blood Chemical Analysis, Brain Chemistry, Cysteine, analysis, Hydrochloric Acid, pharmacology, Indicators and Reagents, Liver, analysis, Spectrophotometry

Guanase has been purified 200-fold in 20% yield from the supernatant fraction of rabbit-liver homogenates, by using ammonium sulphate fractionation, calcium phosphate-gel adsorption and chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and Sephadex G-200. 2. K(m) with guanine as substrate at the optimum pH of 7.7 was found to be 1.05x10(-5)m. Q(10) was 1.4 between 23 degrees and 48 degrees . 3.

16048804<The regulation of propionate oxidation in Prototheca zopfii.<1. Whole cell suspensions of Prototheca zopfii grown on propionate oxidize propionate, acrylate, malonic semialdehyde and acetate immediately, whereas acetate-grown cells only oxidize acrylate or propionate rapidly after a lag of 20-30min. This adaptation to propionate is slowed down by 8-azaguanine or p-fluorophenylalanine, and is not influenced by adding an ammonium salt or an amino acid mixture. 2. The adaptation involves induction of the enzymes of beta-oxidation of propionate. 3. A small proportion (5-8%) of the activities of propionyl-CoA dehydrogenase, beta-hydroxypropionate dehydrogenase and malonic semialdehyde dehydrogenase are consistently associated with mitochondria isolated from propionate-grown cells. 4. Such mitochondria will oxidize propionyl-CoA, beta-hydroxypropionate and malonic semialdehyde, and the respiration rates with these substrates in the presence of inorganic phosphate are ADP-dependent. 5. Mitochondria from acetate-grown cells do not contain detectable activities of the enzymes of propionate oxidation.<Acetates, metabolism, Adaptation, Physiological, drug effects, Azaguanine, pharmacology, Enzyme Induction, Eukaryota, metabolism, Mitochondria, enzymology, Oxidation-Reduction, Oxidoreductases, metabolism, Propionates, metabolism
16048805<Studies with tryptophan metabolites in vitro. Kynurenine metabolism in liver homogenates of normal and Schistosoma mansoni-infested mice.<The conversion of kynurenine into kynurenic acid and anthranilic acid in both normal and Schistosoma mansoni-infested mouse liver was investigated. It was found that in the S. mansoni-infested mouse liver there is probably a deficiency of pyridoxal phosphate that resulted in an inhibition of kynurenine transaminase and a low production of kynurenic acid. Deoxypyridoxine and its phosphorylated derivative inhibited kynurenine transaminase in the normal liver in a pattern qualitatively similar to that observed with infested liver. The lowered concentration of pyridoxal phosphate in the infested liver is discussed in view of the possibility of two combined mechanisms: (a) an antimetabolite being secreted by the infesting worms or present in its eggs that partially inhibited the phosphorylation of pyridoxal, and (b) concentration of pyridoxal phosphate by the worms, resulting in a lowered concentration of the cofactor in the host tissue.<Animals, Kinetics, Kynurenine, metabolism, Liver, metabolism, Mice, Perfusion, Pyridoxal Phosphate, metabolism, Pyridoxine, pharmacology, Schistosomiasis, metabolism, Tryptophan, metabolism, ortho-Aminobenzoates, metabolism
16048806<A study of three enzymes acting on glucose in the lens of different species.<1. The activities of three enzymes which act on glucose, namely hexokinase, aldose reductase and glucose dehydrogenase, were measured in extracts of eye lens from cow, calf, rabbit, rat and guinea pig, and in human cataractous lenses. 2. The K(m) (glucose) of these three enzymes in extracts of cow lens was found to be 0.12mm, 28mm and 690mm respectively. 3.

16048807<The activities and kinetic properties of purine phosphoribosyltransferases in developing mouse liver.<1. The total activity of adenine phosphoribosyltransferase/liver of mice remained constant from 1 to 16 days after birth despite a fourfold increase in liver weight. The total activity of this enzyme increased fivefold from 16 to 36 days and then remained relatively constant at least until 96 days after birth. Total hypoxanthine-phosphoribosyltransferase activity/liver steadily increased between 1 and 57 days after birth. 2. The mean K(m) of 5-phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate with adenine phosphoribosyltransferase was 10.1mum between 3 and 11 days, at 64 days and at 96 days after birth. Between 17 and 51 days the mean K(m) value was 3.0mum. The K(m) of 5-phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate with hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase remained constant at 28.2mum between 2 and 64 days. 3. Adenine-phosphoribosyltransferase activity was stimulated between 15 and 83% by 60mum-ATP when extracts were made between 3 and 11 days, at 64 days or at 96 days after birth. Between 17 and 51 days ATP had little stimulatory effect on the activity of this enzyme. 4. AMP competed with 5-phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate in the reaction catalysed by adenine phosphoribosyltransferase. Liver extracts containing enzyme with a low value of K(m) for 5-phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (3mum) had a K(m)/K(i) ratio approximately half that of extracts with a high value of K(m) (10mum). 5. The results indicate that two different forms of adenine phosphoribosyltransferase can exist in mouse liver at different stages of development. The physiological significance of these findings is discussed.<Adenine, metabolism, Adenosine Triphosphate, pharmacology, Animals, Animals, Newborn, Female, Glucosyltransferases, metabolism, Hypoxanthines, metabolism, Kinetics, Liver, growth &amp; development, Mice
16048808<Oxidation of pyrimidine nucleosides and nucleotides by osmium tetroxide.<1. Pyrimidine nucleosides such as thymidine, uridine or cytidine are oxidized readily at 0 degrees by osmium tetroxide in ammonium chloride buffer. There is virtually no oxidation in bicarbonate buffer of similar pH. Oxidation of 1-methyluracil yields 5,6-dihydro-4,5,6-trihydroxy-1-methyl-2-pyrimidone. 2. Osmium tetroxide and ammonia react reversibly in aqueous solution to form a yellow 1:1 complex, probably OsO(3)NH. A second molecule of ammonia must be involved in the oxidation of UMP since the rate of this reaction is approximately proportional to the square of the concentration of unprotonated ammonia. 3. 4-Thiouridine reacts with osmium tetroxide much more rapidly than does uridine. The changes of absorption spectra are different in sodium bicarbonate buffer and in ammonium chloride buffer. They occur faster in the latter buffer and, under suitable conditions, cytidine is a major product. 4. Polyuridylic acid is oxidized readily by ammoniacal osmium tetroxide, but its oxidation is inhibited by polyadenylic acid. Pyrimidines of yeast amino acid-transfer RNA are oxidized more slowly than the corresponding mononucleosides, especially the thymine residues. Appreciable oxidation can occur without change of sedimentation coefficient.<Chromatography, Nucleosides, Nucleotides, Osmium, pharmacology, Oxidation-Reduction, Polynucleotides, Quaternary Ammonium Compounds, pharmacology, RNA, metabolism, Spectrophotometry, Ultracentrifugation
16048809<The calcium-stimulated incorporation of ethanolamine and serine into the phospholipids of the housefly Musca domestica.<1. The calcium-stimulated incorporation of [2-(14)C]ethanolamine and l-[3-(14)C]-serine into the phospholipids of homogenates of the fat bodies from larval houseflies (Musca domestica) was studied. 2. Ethanolamine and serine acted as competitive inhibitors with one another. N-Methylethanolamine was not distinguished from ethanolamine by the system. Tris buffer was also a competitor with these compounds, and a number of other amino alcohols were inhibitory, probably competitively. 3. The incorporation of [(32)P]phosphorylethanolamine into phospholipids was observed in suspensions of whole fat bodies. This incorporation was stimulated by magnesium. 4. During the incubation of the homogenates, a calcium-stimulated breakdown of phospholipids by a phospholipase A occurred. 5.

16048867<Use of helical wheels to represent the structures of proteins and to identify segments with helical potential.<The three-dimensional structures of alpha-helices can be represented by two-dimensional projections which we call helical wheels. Initially, the wheels were employed as graphical restatements of the known structures determined by Kendrew, Perutz, Watson, and their colleagues at the University of Cambridge and by Phillips and his coworkers at The Royal Institution. The characteristics of the helices, discussed by Perutz et al. (1965), and Blake et al. (1965), can be readily visualized by examination of these wheels. For example, the projections for most helical segments of myoglobin, hemoglobin, and lysozyme have distinctive hydrophobic arcs. Moreover, the hydrophobic residues tend to be clustered in the n +/- 3, n, n +/- 4 positions of adjacent helical turns. Such hydrophobic arcs are not observed when the sequences of nonhelical segments are plotted on the wheels. Since the features of these projections are also distinctive, however, the wheels can be used to divide sequences into segments with either helical or nonhelical potential. The sequences of insulin, cytochrome c, ribonuclease A, chymotrypsinogen A, tobacco mosaic virus protein, and human growth hormone were chosen for application of the wheels for this purpose.<Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, Cattle, Cetacea, Chymotrypsin, analysis, Cytochromes, analysis, Growth Hormone, analysis, Horses, Humans, Insulin, analysis, Models, Chemical, Muramidase, analysis, Myoglobin, analysis, Proteins, analysis, Ribonucleases, analysis, Tobacco Mosaic Virus, analysis, Viral Proteins, analysis
16048868<An analysis of the surface fixed-charge theory of the squid giant axon membrane.<The observed shift in threshold potential, after perfusion of the squid giant axon with solutions of low ionic strength, can be predicted by assuming a fixed negative charge on the inside of the membrane. The constant field equation, together with the double-layer potential due to this charge, has been used to determine the change in resting potential during perfusion with solutions of low ionic strength. Neither the modified constant field equation nor Planck's diffusion equation can successfully predict the observed shift in resting potential. It is suggested that a positive charge distribution exists about the sodium channel on the outside of the membrane. The double-layer potential due to this positive charge, together with the independence principle, has been used to predict the relationship between sodium current and membrane potential when the ionic strength and sodium activity of the external solution are decreased. These predictions have been compared with the available experimental observations.<Animals, Axons, Membrane Potentials, Models, Theoretical, Mollusca, Perfusion, Sodium, metabolism
16048869<Wave propagation in a viscous fluid contained in an orthotropic elastic tube.<The problem of pressure wave propagation through a viscous fluid contained in an orthotropic elastic tube is considered in connection with arterial blood flow. Solutions to the fluid flow and elasticity equations are obtained for the presence of a reflected wave. Numerical results are presented for both isotropic and orthotropic elastic tubes. In particular, the pressure pulse, flow rate, axial fluid velocity, and wall displacements are plotted vs. time at various stations along the ascending aorta of man. The results indicate an increase in the peak value of the pressure pulse and a decrease in the flow rate as the pulse propagates away from the heart. Finally, the velocity of wave propagation depends mainly on the tangential modulus of elasticity of the arterial wall, and anisotropy of the wall accounts in part for the reduction of longitudinal movements and an increase in the hydraulic resistance.<Aorta, physiology, Blood Flow Velocity, Blood Pressure, Elasticity, Heart Rate, Humans, Mathematics, Models, Theoretical, Rheology, Viscosity

I.<The availability of very high magnetic fields of up to 170,000 gauss made it worthwhile to pursue the search for a critical change in the rate of four enzyme substrate reactions. The four enzymes were ribonuclease, polyphenol oxidase, peroxidase, and aldolase.

This "pretreatment" was allowed to proceed for as long as 3(2/3) hr in a magnetic field of 208 kgauss at temperatures 26 and 36 degrees C. No effect on reactivity was observed when such pretreated enzyme solutions were compared with identical but untreated enzyme solutions. A single such reaction, allowed to proceed directly in a magnetic field of 220 kgauss for 9 min, similarly showed no difference in rate from its control.<Anilides, metabolism, Arginine, metabolism, Benzoates, metabolism, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Kinetics, Magnetics, Spectrophotometry, Temperature, Trypsin, metabolism
16048872<Changes in intensity and spectral distribution of fluorescence. Effect of light treatment on normal and DCMU-poisoned Anacystis nidulans.<The intensity of the "steady-state" fluorescence of "aerobic" Anacystis nidulans is variable under prolonged illumination with orange (590 mmu) or blue (440 mmu) light for both normally photosynthesizing and DCMU-poisoned cells. In general, orange light illumination causes an increase of the fluorescence intensity followed by a decrease, while blue light causes an increase until a steady level is reached. Poisoned Anacystis cells show four to eight times larger changes in fluorescence intensity than the normal cells; the detailed time course of fluorescence changes is also different in poisoned and normal cells. When algae are cooled to -196 degrees C in light, the light-induced changes in the "steady-state" fluorescence disappear in both types of cells. Difference fluorescence spectra, constructed by subtracting the fluorescence spectra taken after 5-15 min of illumination from those after 60-90 min of illumination, show a doublet structure of the difference band with a major peak coinciding with the Anacystis emission maximum (685 mmu) and a minor peak located at about 693 mmu.<Chlorophyll, Eukaryota, drug effects, Fluorescence, Kinetics, Light, Photosynthesis, Spectrum Analysis, Temperature, Urea, pharmacology
16048873<The application of electromagnetic theory to electrocardiology. I. Derivation of the integral equations.<One of the fundamental problems of theoretical electrocardiology is to determine the potential distribution on the surface of the torso due to the time-varying dipolar heart source. In this paper we present a rigorous derivation of the integro-differential equations for the potential, containing, for the first time, the effects of the time dependence of the source and the dielectric properties of the medium. These equations provide a general and rigorous basis from which to attack the problem numerically on a computer and permit the use of a detailed model of the thorax as a multiple region volume of different dielectric and conducting properties.<Biophysical Phenomena, Biophysics, Electrocardiography, Humans, Mathematics, Models, Theoretical, Thorax
16048874<Permeation of water through cation exchange membranes.<Water permeabilities as well as other membrane parameters, such as exchange capacity, water content, and specific conductance, have been measured for two cation exchange membranes in the H form. The conductance of membrane with low water content was less than that of the membrane with high water content. These data have been discussed in the light of an existing theory and found inadequate to explain the results in a quantitative way. Water permeability of the membranes subject to mechanical pressure was found to be higher than their isotopic water permeability, according to expectation. These data have been examined from the standpoint of thermodynamic and kinetic theories of water flow in membranes and used to estimate the average size of membrane pores.<Chemical Phenomena, Chemistry, Physical, Ion Exchange, Membranes, Artificial, Permeability, Tritium, Water
16048875<On the relative contribution of viscous flow vs. diffusional (frictional) flow to the stationary state flow of water through a "tight" membrane.<The practice of calculating the diffusion contribution to the total pressure-driven flow of water through a tight membrane by using the self-diffusion coefficient for tritiated water is examined by a theoretical analysis. Equations of motion for water and membrane in pressure-driven water flow and water, membrane, and tritiated water in self-diffusion of tritiated water are adapted from Bearman and Kirkwood (1958). These equations of motion are used to develop an equation for the pressure-driven flow of water. Because of the lack of specific information about the detailed structure of most membranes, as well as considerations of the need to eliminate some of the mathematical difficulties, an "equivalent capillary" model is used to find a solution to the equation of motion.

The resulting equation for diffusion by a succession of spontaneous jumps has been well stated by Parlin and Eyring. This paper will consider one simple case in which a different assumption is reasonable. Diffusion of monovalent positive ions is considered as a series of jumps from one fixed negative site to another. The sites are assumed to be full (electrical neutrality). Interaction occurs by the displacement of one ion by another. An ion leaves a site if and only if another ion, not necessarily of the same species, attempts to occupy the same site. Flux ratios and net fluxes are given as functions of the electrical potential, concentration ratios, and number of sites encountered in crossing the membrane. Quantitative comparisons with observations of Hodgkin and Keynes are presented.<Ions, Membranes, Artificial, Models, Theoretical, Rheology
16048877<The time dependence of single file diffusion.<The single file diffusion of particles through a narrow pore membrane separating two media is treated as a stochastic birth and death process. A set of differential-difference equations is derived to describe the probability of finding n particles in the pore at any time whose source is the left-hand medium. Explicit time-dependent solutions for an arbitary number of sites are obtained. These can be used to calculate both one-way and net flux as a function of time. Parameters are estimated from steady state permeability data, and the results of some numerical calculations are presented to illustrate the time required to approach a steady state. In many cases, significant time delays can occur.<Mathematics, Membranes, Artificial, Models, Theoretical, Permeability, Time
16048878<A theoretical prediction of the normal cardiac oxygen consumption.<A model is described from which the entropy production associated with the process of transporting oxygen and carbon dioxide between the lungs and the muscles of the body can be calculated. The two entropy sources which are assumed to be the dominant ones for this process are the entropy production associated with the metabolism of the heart and the entropy production associated with the diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide into and out of the blood. The hypothesis that the observed blood flow is the one for which a given amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide is transported between the lungs and the muscles with minimum total entropy production is used to predict the value of the slope of the cardiac oxygen consumption vs. blood flow curve. At a blood flow of 15 liters/min, the predicted value of the slope of this curve is 1.2 ml/liter.<Biophysical Phenomena, Biophysics, Blood Flow Velocity, Carbon Dioxide, metabolism, Humans, Lung, metabolism, Models, Theoretical, Muscles, metabolism, Myocardium, metabolism, Oxygen Consumption, Thermodynamics
16048879<Thermodynamics of light emission and free-energy storage in photosynthesis.<A Planck law relationship between absorption and emission spectra is used to compute the fluorescence spectra of some photosynthetic systems from their absorption spectra. Calculated luminescence spectra of purple bacteria agree well but not perfectly with published experimental spectra. Application of the Planck law relation to published activation spectra for Systems I and II of spinach chloroplasts permits independent calculation of the luminescence spectra of the two systems; if the luminescence yield of System I is taken to be one-third the yield of System II, then the combined luminescence spectrum closely fits published experimental measurement.Consideration of the entropy associated with the excited state of the absorbing molecules is used to compute the oxidation-reduction potentials and maximum free-energy storage resulting from light absorption. Spinach chloroplasts under an illumination of 1 klux of white light can produce at most a potential difference of 1.32 ev for System I, and 1.36 ev for System II. In the absence of nonradiative losses, the maximum amount of free energy stored is 1.19 ev and 1.23 ev per photon absorbed for Systems I and II, respectively. The bacterium Chromatium under an illumination of 1 mw/cm(2) of Na D radiation can produce at most a potential difference of 0.90 ev; the maximum amount of free energy stored is 0.79 ev per photon absorbed.The combined effect of partial thermodynamic reversibility and a finite trapping rate on the amount of luminescence is considered briefly.<Chloroplasts, Chromatium, Fluorescence, Light, Luminescence, Photosynthesis, Plants, Edible, Spectrum Analysis, Thermodynamics
16048993<Respiratory function during thermal tachypnoea in sheep.<1. Four Merino wethers were exposed to dry bulb temperatures ranging from approximately 20 to 60 degrees C, and the concurrent changes in respiratory frequency, tidal volume, respiratory minute volume, alveolar ventilation, dead space ventilation, carbon dioxide output, rectal temperature, and arterial and mixed venous blood, CO(2) content, CO(2) partial pressure and pH were established.2. The respiratory response to heat exposure showed two phases. Respiratory minute volume was initially increased by a rise in the respiratory frequency, while tidal volume decreased. After more prolonged exposure there was a second phase in which respiratory minute volume was further increased by an increase in the tidal volume; respiratory frequency was now slower than in the first phase but was still well above control values.3. The increase in respiratory minute volume during the first phase of the response was restricted almost entirely to the respiratory dead space; changes in blood CO(2) and pH were slight. In the second phase, respiratory minute volume showed a much greater increase, and a change of alveolar ventilation to about 5 times the control level resulted in severe respiratory alkalosis.4. Contrary to findings in cattle, the slower, deeper form of respiration could be elicited even with rectal temperature in the normal range. This change in respiration appears to be the result of either peripheral thermoreceptor function or mechanical demands of the respiratory system. The neglect of control of acid-base balance during the second phase indicates the existence of a dominant thermal stimulus or modification of respiratory control mechanisms.<Animals, Body Temperature Regulation, physiology, Carbon Dioxide, analysis, blood, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Respiration, physiology, Sheep
16048996<The effect of 5-hydroxytryptamine on the potassium exchange of human platelets.<1. The concentration of potassium in platelets freshly isolated from nine persons was 74 +/- 4.8 mumole/10(11) platelets (mean +/- S.E.M.).2. The influx of potassium into platelets from citrated plasma at 37 degrees C, estimated with the use of (42)K, was 18.3 +/- 1.6 n-mole/sec. 10(11) platelets.3. When plasma contained 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) at a concentration of about 5 mug/ml., the influx of potassium into platelets was increased for as long as they took up 5-HT. This effect was absent when the concentration of 5-HT was either lower (2 mug/ml.) or much higher (50 mug/ml.).4. The concentration of 5-HT in the platelets did not affect their potassium flux.<Blood Platelets, drug effects, Humans, Potassium, blood, Potassium Isotopes, Serotonin, pharmacology
16048997<The effect of withdrawal of visual presentation of errors upon the frequency spectrum of tremor in a manual task.<1. When a subject attempts to exert a steady pressure on a joystick he makes small unavoidable errors which, irrespective of their origin or frequency, may be called tremor.2. Frequency analysis shows that low frequencies always contribute much more to the total error than high frequencies. If the subject is not allowed to check his performance visually, but has to rely on sensations of pressure in the finger tips, etc., the error power spectrum plotted on logarithmic co-ordinates approximates to a straight line falling at 6 db/octave from 0.4 to 9 c/s. In other words the amplitude of the tremor component at each frequency is inversely proportional to frequency.3. When the subject is given a visual indication of his errors on an oscilloscope the shape of the tremor spectrum alters. The most striking change is the appearance of a tremor peak at about 9 c/s, but there is also a significant increase of error in the range 1-4 c/s. The extent of these changes varies from subject to subject.4. If the 9 c/s peak represents oscillation of a muscle length-servo it would appear that greater use is made of this servo when positional information is available from the eyes than when proprioceptive impulses from the limbs have to be relied on.<Humans, Male, Muscle Contraction, physiology, Muscles, physiology, Tremor, Vision, Ocular
16048998<Acetate metabolism in the isolated sheep foetus.<1. Sheep foetuses over the age range 105-142 days and maintained on an extracorporeal circuit removed exogenous acetate at 2.0-4.9 mg/kg.min.2. Urinary loss of acetate was less than 12.5% of the administered amount.3. The rate of acetate removal appeared to be unaffected by the addition of glucose to the circuit. The removal of glucose also seemed to be unaffected by the presence of acetate.4. A decline in the plasma concentration of free fatty acids and ketone bodies was also observed during the perfusion.5. It is concluded that under these conditions acetate may have accounted for about one half of the oxygen consumption. The contribution of free fatty acids and ketone bodies must have been small. The relevance of these findings to the nutrition of the foetus in utero is discussed.<Acetates, blood, metabolism, urine, Animals, Blood Glucose, analysis, Extracorporeal Circulation, Fatty Acids, blood, Fetus, metabolism, Fructose, blood, Ketone Bodies, blood, Oxygen Consumption, Sheep
16049000<The effect of a non-ionic detergent (Triton WR 1339) on the removal of triglyceride fatty acids from the blood of the rat.<1. The initial rate of removal from the circulation of injected [(14)C] labelled chylomicron triglyceride is much slower in rats that have been injected with the non-ionic detergent, Triton WR 1339, than in normal animals. Pre-incubation of the lipid with Triton before its injection causes a further reduction in removal rate.2. After the injection of [(14)C]labelled chyle triglyceride into animals given Triton, the rate of disappearance of radioactivity falls markedly as the percentage of the labelled material remaining in the blood declines.3. A much smaller decrease in the rate of removal of injected chylomicron triglyceride occurs with increase in the size of the injected dose and with increase in the time interval between Triton and chylomicron triglyceride injections.4. Serum triglycerides labelled with (14)C are removed from the circulation of rats that have been given Triton at a much slower rate than [(14)C] labelled chylomicron triglycerides.<Animals, Carbon Isotopes, Chylomicrons, blood, Rats, Surface-Active Agents, pharmacology, Triglycerides, blood
16049002<The use of a non-ionic detergent (Triton WR 1339) to determine rates of triglyceride entry into the circulation of the rat under different physiological conditions.<1. The concentration of triglyceride in the plasma rises linearly for 3 hr after the intravenous injection of the non-ionic detergent, Triton WR 1339, in the rat.2. Minimum rates of triglyceride entry into the plasma have been calculated from measurements of the plasma triglyceride concentration at 1.5 hr after Triton injection. These are 30 and 52 mumoles/hr.200 g body weight respectively for male and female animals on a stock laboratory diet and 25 and 33 mumoles/hr.200 g body weight respectively for male and female animals starved for 48 hr. The values may have to be increased by 10 or 20% to take account of a small leak of triglyceride from the plasma in animals injected with Triton and of an effect of ether anaesthesia on the rate of entry of triglyceride into the plasma.3. Substitution of the stock laboratory diet by diets that are lower in fat content does not alter significantly the rate of triglyceride accumulation in the plasma after Triton injection.4. There is no change in the triglyceride content of the livers of male and female rats at 24 hr after Triton injection. At 6 hr after Triton, the liver triglyceride content of female rats which have been fed their normal diet is increased.<Anesthesia, Animals, Blood Volume Determination, Diet, Female, Liver, analysis, Male, Rats, Spleen, analysis, Starvation, Surface-Active Agents, pharmacology, Triglycerides, blood
16049006<Water uptake by Bufo melanostictus, as affected by osmotic gradients, vasopressin and temperature.<1. The rate of water uptake across the skin was studied in the live toad, Bufo melanostictus. When toads were kept in distilled water at 29 degrees C the uptake of water amounted to 16.9 +/- 1.3 mul./cm(2)/hr; when bathed in sucrose or urea solutions, the water uptake diminished with increasing osmotic pressure. There was no water uptake observed when toads were kept in 200 m-osmolar sucrose or urea.2. Intramuscular injections of vasopressin increased the rate of water uptake from distilled water. There was a good relation between doses and responses over various time intervals. A dose of 4 m-u. vasopressin/g body wt. doubled the rate of water uptake over a period of 1 hr. The same dose of vasopressin doubled the rate of water uptake when the toads were kept in solutions of sucrose or urea of different osmolarity.3. The rate of water uptake when the toads were bathed in sodium chloride solutions was consistently 8 mul./cm(2)/hr greater than when bathed in sucrose or urea solutions of equal osmolarity. There was no water uptake when the sodium chloride solution was 285 m-osmolar.4. Vasopressin (4 m-u./g) injected intramuscularly doubled the rate of water uptake from sodium chloride solutions of different osmolarity.5. With solutions of potassium chloride, sodium nitrate, and potassium nitrate, in concentrations up to 150 m-osmoles/l., the rate of water uptake was found to be the same as with solutions of sodium chloride of the same osmolarity. Similarly, it was doubled by injection of vasopressin (4m-u./g).6. The effect of temperature on the rate of water uptake before and after injection of vasopressin was investigated in toads kept in distilled water, sucrose, or sodium chloride solutions. For temperatures between 20 and 37 degrees C, vasopressin (4 m-u./g) reduced the activation energy involved in the process of water uptake by 4000 cal.7. The results agree with the view that water uptake follows a diffusion process which is facilitated by vasopressin, possibly as a result of increasing the size or number of available pores.<Animals, Anura, Female, Male, Osmosis, Skin, metabolism, Skin Absorption, physiology, Sodium Chloride, pharmacology, Sucrose, pharmacology, Temperature, Vasopressins, pharmacology, Water, metabolism
16049009<The relation between spontaneous activity, metabolic rate and the 24 hour cycle in mice at different environmental temperatures.<1. Oxygen consumption rates and levels of spontaneous activity were recorded simultaneously for mice, both singly and in groups, over 24 hr periods at temperatures ranging from 8 to 37 degrees C.2. There was marked 24 hr variation in both metabolic rate and activity, with maxima during the night; the amplitude of the variation diminished at the lower environmental temperatures.3. At 28-33 degrees C environmental temperatures, increased activity was associated with an increased oxygen consumption rate.4. At 8 and 15 degrees C, increased activity was accompanied by only a small increase in oxygen consumption.5. These results show that thermogenesis from spontaneous activity can take the place of thermoregulatory heat production in the cold.<Animals, Body Temperature, Body Temperature Regulation, physiology, Circadian Rhythm, physiology, Female, Metabolism, physiology, Mice, Oxygen Consumption, Physical Exertion, physiology, Temperature
16049010<The effect of subthreshold potentials on the membrane current in cardiac Purkinje fibres.<1. In sodium-containing solutions, up to 60% of the slow outward current in Purkinje fibres can be activated by depolarizations which are too small to activate the fast sodium conductance responsible for the depolarization phase of the action potential. This result reinforces the view that the slow outward current results from slow activation of the potassium conductance rather than from slow inactivation of the sodium conductance.2. These subthreshold changes in membrane conductance are probably responsible for the dependence of the action potential and pace-maker potential durations on small changes in membrane potential in the subthreshold region.<Action Potentials, physiology, Animals, Cell Membrane, physiology, Heart Conduction System, physiology, Membrane Potentials, physiology, Potassium, Sheep, Sodium
16049291<Computer simulation of fermentation systems.<Results of batch fermentation of gluconic acid by Pseudomonas ovalis were graphically analyzed to obtain a kinetic model to represent the data. Since gluconic acid was produced by the hydrolysis of a lactone intermediate, the model was necessarily represented by a set of kinetic equations. A computer simulation technique involving the use of the MIDAS program was developed to solve the system of nonlinear equations and to check the appropriateness of the model. Since the maximal specific growth rate and the rate constant for the production of the lactone intermediate varied with time, function generators were used to simulate these system parameters. The merit of using the MIDAS program was considered in relation to analysis and model testing in microbiological processes of similar types.<Computers, Gluconates, metabolism, Lactones, metabolism, Models, Theoretical, Pseudomonas, metabolism, Time Factors
16049292<Degradation of hydrocarbons by members of the genus Candida. I. Hydrocarbon assimilation.<A representative number of species of the genus Candida were tested for their ability to utilize n-alkanes of 9 to 18 carbon atoms and even-numbered 1-alkenes of 10 to 18 carbon atoms. A high percentage of these organisms exhibited the ability to assimilate some member of the hydrocarbon series employed. These findings indicate that the ability to assimilate hydrocarbons is not limited to a few species of the genus and may be of some taxonomic significance.<Alkanes, metabolism, Alkenes, metabolism, Candida, metabolism
16049293<Decarboxylation of alpha-keto acids by Streptococcus lactis var. maltigenes.<Decarboxylation rates for a series of C-3 to C-6 alpha-keto acids were determined in the presence of resting cells and cell-free extracts of Streptococcus lactis var. maltigenes. The C-5 and C-6 acids branched at the penultimate carbon atom were converted most rapidly to the respective aldehydes in the manner described for alpha-carboxylases. Pyruvate and alpha-ketobutyrate did not behave as alpha-carboxylase substrates, in that O(2) was absorbed when they were reacted with resting cells. The same effect with pyruvate was noted in a nonmalty S. lactis, accounting for CO(2) produced by some "homofermentative" streptococci. Mixed substrate reactions indicated that the same enzyme was responsible for decarboxylation of alpha-ketoisocaproate and alpha-ketoisovalerate, but it appeared unlikely that this enzyme was responsible for the decarboxylation of pyruvate. Ultrasonic disruption of cells of the malty culture resulted in an extract inactive for decarboxylation of pyruvate in the absence of ferricyanide. Dialyzed cell-free extracts were inactive against all keto acids and could not be reactivated.<Butyrates, metabolism, Caproates, metabolism, Keto Acids, metabolism, Manometry, Pyruvates, metabolism, Streptococcus, metabolism, Ultrasonics, Valerates, metabolism
16049294<Antifungal activity of isothiocyanates and related compounds. I. Naturally occurring isothiocyanates and their analogues.<Data are presented concerning the antifungal activity of 11 natural isothiocyanates and 27 synthetized analogues in Aspergillus niger, Penicillium cyclopium, and Rhizopus oryzae, as well as in 13 additional saprophytic and parasitic fungi. A remarkable antifungal activity was observed in some analogues of benzylisothiocyanate and beta-phenylethylisothiocyanate. The latter-mentioned compounds have not been described previously. In the group of benzylisothiocyanates, a correlation, which was inversely proportional, was detected between ed(100) values for A. niger and R. oryzae and the corresponding molar solubilities of compounds in water. In contradistinction, no relationship was observed between antifungal activity and chemical reactivity of investigated derivatives.<Antifungal Agents, pharmacology, Aspergillus, drug effects, Fungi, drug effects, Penicillium, drug effects, Rhizopus, drug effects, Thiocyanates, chemical synthesis, pharmacology
16049295<Antifungal activity of isothiocyanates and related compounds. II. Mononuclear aromatic isothiocyanates.<Antifungal activity on Aspergillus niger, Penicillium cyclopium, and Rhizopus oryzae, as well as on additional saprophytic and parasitic fungi, was determined in 57 substituted derivatives of phenylisothiocyanate. Most of the investigated compounds displayed rather equal activity against the three mentioned fungi, in contradistinction to the analogues of natural benzyl- and beta-phenylethylisothiocyanate with their characteristic low activity against R. oryzae. Differences occurred in the type of activity of compounds in which the -NCS group is directly bound on the aromatic moiety, as compared with those compounds in which this group is bound to the aliphatic radical or to the aromatic moiety indirectly by means of the methyl group or by a longer aliphatic chain. The results obtained confirm the negative influence of ionized substituents on the aromatic moiety, i.e., of -COOH, -CH(2)- COOH, and -SO(3)H groups, as well as of substituents which cause an extreme increase in reactivity of the -NCS group resulting in a high instability of the entire isothiocyanate molecule.<Antifungal Agents, pharmacology, Aspergillus, drug effects, Penicillium, drug effects, Rhizopus, drug effects, Thiocyanates, chemical synthesis, pharmacology

16049297<Elution of loosely bound acid phosphatase from Staphylococcus aureus.<Strains of Staphylococcus aureus from the International-Blair and the Seto-Wilson series of phage propagating strains were examined for acid phosphatase activity. This enzyme was found to occur in varying amounts in three different fractions: free (6 to 60%), loosely bound (25 to 82%), and firmly bound (0 to 46%). Propagating strain 3A, because of its high activity, was chosen for further study. The rate of enzyme production paralleled cell growth in Trypticase Soy Broth, but followed a biphasic pattern in a semisynthetic casein acid-hydrolysate medium with glyceryl phosphate. Maximal elution of acid phosphatase in the loosely bound fraction, presumably from the surface of cells, occurred in the alkaline pH range. From log-phase cells, elution was maximally effected with buffered 1.0 M KCl (pH 7.5), but stationary-phase cells required twice the concentration of KCl.<Acid Phosphatase, metabolism, Culture Media, Glucose, metabolism, Staphylococcus, enzymology
16049298<Utilization of carbon and nitrogen-containing compounds for neomycin production by Streptomyces fradiae.<A number of carbon and nitrogen compounds were tested for their effect on growth of Streptomyces fradiae 3535 and neomycin production. Dextrin, starch, and maltose were excellent carbon sources for neomycin production, and sodium nitrate, aspartic acid, and glutamic acid were adequate nitrogen sources. Studies on biochemical changes during fermentation in four typical media indicated that there was no direct relation between the growth of the organism and neomycin formation. The pH of the medium might be an important factor for neomycin synthesis. The quantitative formation of neomycin components depended on the variation of carbon and nitrogen sources. On the basis of this study, a suitable synthetic medium for neomycin production has been developed.<Alcohols, metabolism, Amino Acids, metabolism, Ammonium Chloride, metabolism, Carbohydrate Metabolism, Neomycin, biosynthesis, Nitrates, metabolism, Streptomyces, metabolism
16049299<In vitro antibacterial activity of kasugamycin.<Kasugamycin is an aminoglycosidic antibiotic which was initially reported as being of potential use against Pseudomonas. Our evaluation of this antibiotic does not confirm this expectation. The median minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the Pseudomonas strains tested was 250 mug/ml and the bactericidal level was 500 mug/ml. Kasugamycin was found to be slightly more active in a more basic medium (Mycin Assay broth) in which the median MIC for 11 Pseudomonas strains was 125 mug/ml. Kasugamycin manifests a modest degree of serum binding. Kasugamycin did not have any appreciable effect against a variety of bacteria tested. The only exceptions were several species of gram-negative bacteria, against which more satisfactory antibiotics already exist. Further evaluation of kasugamycin for potential human use as an antipseudomonal agent does not appear warranted.<Anti-Bacterial Agents, pharmacology, Bacteria, drug effects, Colistin, pharmacology, Culture Media, Pseudomonas, drug effects
16049300<Microbial penicillinase in soft types of cheese.<Penicillinase activity was found in commercial samples of Limburger, Liederkranz, and Brick, as well as in Roquefort and Danish Blue cheeses. The numbers of penicillinase-producing bacteria in the cheese flora were estimated by use of the most probable numbers technique coupled with penicillinase determinations on the individual cultures. Although streptococci constituted the predominant flora in most of the samples, significant numbers of penicillinase-producing bacteria were also observed. Six of seven penicillinase-producing isolates that were studied in detail were micrococci; the other was an unidentified gram-positive, catalase-positive rod. The results suggest the widespread occurrence of penicillinase-forming micrococci on the surfaces of soft types of cheese.<Bacteria, enzymology, Cheese, Penicillinase, metabolism
16049301<Fate of free amino acids and nucleotides in spoiling beef.<Fresh beef allowed to undergo microbial spoilage at 7 C showed decreases in quantity and types of amino acids as well as decreases in nucleotides when the initial number of bacteria per gram was high. When the initial number of bacteria was low, decreases were either not detectable or of low orders. It seems, therefore, that low-molecular-weight compounds of the above type support the growth of beef-spoilage bacteria rather than primary beef proteins. These low-molecular-weight compounds provide the probable sources of ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and other such compounds associated with beef allowed to spoil at low temperatures.<Amino Acids, metabolism, Bacteria, isolation &amp; purification, Chromatography, Paper, Food Irradiation, Food Microbiology, Meat, Nucleotides, metabolism, Temperature
16049302<Bacteriology of spoilage of fish muscle. IV. Role of protein.<Clarified muscle press juice from English sole (Parophrys vetulus) was fractionated by gel filtration into a protein and a protein-free fraction. Upon inoculation with spoilage bacteria, the protein fraction failed to show any signs of spoilage, but the protein-free fraction spoiled according to the usual organoleptic and chemical criteria. Despite its spoilage-resistant qualities, the protein fraction accelerated spoilage of the protein-free fraction when the two were combined. Protein breadkown due to bacterial action was greatest in the unfractionated juice and was least in the protein fraction. No significant proteolysis occurred until after spoilage became evident.<Amines, metabolism, Fish Products, Food Microbiology, Proteins, metabolism, Pseudomonas, metabolism
16049303<Effect of various essential oils isolated from Douglas fir needles upon sheep and deer rumen microbial activity.<The effects of essential oils isolated from Douglas fir needles on sheep and deer rumen microbial activity were tested by use of an anaerobic manometric technique. Rumen microorganisms were obtained from a sheep which had been fed mainly on alfalfa hay and dried range grass. One deer used in this study had access to Douglas fir trees the year around, whereas the other deer had no access to Douglas fir. All of the monoterpene hydrocarbons isolated from Douglas fir needles-alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, limonene, myrcene, camphene, Delta(3)-carene, and terpinolene-promoted only slightly or had no effect on deer rumen microbial activity, whereas all of them promoted activity in sheep rumen microbes, except Delta(3)-carene and terpinolene, which inhibited activity. Of the oxygenated monoterpenes, all monoterpene alcohols-alpha-terpineol, terpinen-4-ol, linalool, citronellol, and fenchyl alcohol-strongly inhibited the rumen microbial activity of both sheep and deer. Monoterpene esters (bornyl acetate) produced mild inhibition for both sheep and deer microbes, and citronellyl acetate inhibited rumen microbial activity in sheep, whereas it promoted activity in both deer. Monoterpene aldehyde (citronellal) inhibited the activity of rumen microbes from both sheep and deer having no access to Douglas fir from the Hopland Field Station, whereas they produced no effect upon the deer having access to Douglas fir from the Masonite forest. Rumen microbial activity for sheep and deer was promoted slightly with aliphatic ester (ethyl-n-caproate). There was a marked difference between sheep and deer rumen microbes as affected by addition of the various essential oils. The monoterpene hydrocarbons promoted activity more on sheep rumen microbes than on deer, and the monoterpene alcohols inhibited sheep rumen microbial activity more than that of deer. Furthermore, the deer rumen microbes from Hopland Field Station were affected more than the deer from Masonite forest.<Animals, Bacteria, drug effects, Deer, Manometry, Oils, Volatile, pharmacology, Rumen, microbiology, Sheep
16049304<Chemical determination of leucogenenol and its production by Penicillium gilmanii.<A method for the quantitative determination of leucogenenol, a leucocytosis-inducing compound produced by Penicillium gilmanii, has been developed. The formation of leucogenenol in P. gilmanii and its diffusion into the culture fluid has been followed over a period of 12 weeks. The highest concentration of leucogenenol was found in the mycelium of rapidly growing cultures. The greatest concentration occurred in the culture fluid, however, after cessation of rapid growth. The concentration of leucogenenol in the mycelium of cultures over 4 weeks old fluctuated widely. This fluctuation was apparently due to the formation and rapid growth of daughter colonies.<Culture Media, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Leukocytosis, chemically induced, Penicillium, growth &amp; development, metabolism, Spectrophotometry
16049305<Microbial hydrocarbon co-oxidation. I. Oxidation of mono- and dicyclic hydrocarbons by soil isolates of the genus Nocardia.<Nocardia cultures, isolated from soil by use of n-paraffins as the sole carbon source, have been shown to bring about significant oxidation of several methyl-substituted mono- and dicyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Oxygen uptake by washed cell suspensions was not a reliable indicator of oxidation. Under co-oxidation conditions in shaken flasks, o- and p-xylenes were oxidized to their respective mono-aromatic acids, o-toluic and p-toluic acids. In addition, a new fermentation product, 2, 3-dihydroxy-p-toluic acid, was found in the p-xylene oxidation system. Of 10 methyl-substituted naphthalenes tested (1-methyl, 2-methyl, 1, 3-dimethyl, 1, 4-dimethyl, 1, 5-dimethyl, 1, 8-dimethyl, 1, 6-dimethyl, 2, 3-dimethyl, 2, 6-dimethyl, 2, 7-dimethyl), only those containing a methyl group in the beta position were oxidized at this position to the mono acid.<Hydrocarbons, metabolism, Nocardia, metabolism, Oxidation-Reduction, Soil Microbiology
16049306<Nutritional requirements of Staphylococcus aureus S-6.<A synthetic medium was devised for growth of Staphylococcus aureus strain S-6. The growth yield in synthetic medium was compared to that in complex medium containing an equivalent amount of protein hydrolysate. Enterotoxin B formation in the two media was also compared. The defined medium was composed of inorganic salts, 11 amino acids (glycine, valine, leucine, threonine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, cysteine, methionine, proline, arginine, and histidine), and three vitamins (thiamine, nicotinic acid, and biotin). Biotin was a growth factor requirement of S-6 when glutamic acid but not glucose was used as a carbon source. The quantity of enterotoxin B produced in the defined medium was about one-seventh of that produced in complex medium, even though the growth yields were similar.<Amino Acids, metabolism, Culture Media, Enterotoxins, biosynthesis, Staphylococcus, metabolism, Vitamins, metabolism
16049307<Sporulation of the "thermophilic anaerobes".<A reasonable degree of synchrony in the sporulation of Clostridium thermosaccharolyticum 3814 was obtained by using three 10% transfers of 8-hr cultures in a medium containing 0.5% L-arabinose, 0.5% peptone, 0.5% yeast extract, and Gc minerals. Sporulation was stimulated by L-arabinose and L-xylose, but was repressed by glucose, mannose, fructose, and D-pentoses. Sporulating cells were long and thin, whereas repressed cells were shorter and thicker. The optimal pH for sporulation was in the range of pH 5.0 to 5.5. As sporulation continued, the accumulated acetate decreased. Label studies indicated that a significant amount of acetate-2-C(14) was incorporated into the spore lipid. The calcium, phosphorus, and dipicolinic acid (DPA) concentrations on a dry weight basis were 2.55, 2.60, and 7.25%, respectively. The molar ratio of Ca-DPA was 1.47.<Arabinose, metabolism, Clostridium, growth &amp; development, Culture Media, Fructose, metabolism, Galactose, metabolism, Glucose, metabolism, Mannose, metabolism, Ribose, metabolism, Spores, growth &amp; development, Xylose, metabolism
16049308<Stability of rubella complement-fixing antigens.<Various types of rubella complement-fixing (CF) antigen preparations derived from infected BHK-21 cell cultures were examined for stability to certain chemical and physical agents. Antigens studied included: infected culture fluids concentrated 100-fold, ether-treated fluid concentrates, alkaline buffer extracts of infected cells, and large- and small-particle CF antigens separated by Sephadex gel filtration. All preparations were stable at -20 C for months, and were unaffected by three cycles of freezing and thawing. Ether treatment rendered antigens highly susceptible to thermal inactivation at 56 C; untreated antigens were inactivated slowly and showed a persistent fraction of activity even after 2 hr. Large-particle antigen was found to be slightly more susceptible than small-particle antigen to thermal inactivation and ether treatment. CF activity in alkaline buffer extracts was more labile than that in untreated or ether-treated fluid concentrates upon dialysis, Sephadex gel filtration, and sucrose density gradient centrifugation.<Antigens, analysis, Centrifugation, Density Gradient, Chromatography, Gel, Complement Fixation Tests, Ethyl Ethers, pharmacology, Freezing, Hot Temperature, Rubella virus, immunology
16049309<Diploid hybridization in a heterothallic haploid yeast, Saccharomyces rouxii.<By crossing of a heterothallic haploid yeast, Saccharomyces rouxii, we have succeeded in obtaining diploid hybrids. This paper shows one possible method of breeding heterothallic haploid yeasts for industrial application. S. rouxii is highly salt-tolerant and plays an important role in shoyu and miso fermentation. Therefore, genetic improvements of the properties are of commercial importance. Since newly isolated S. rouxii could neither conjugate nor sporulate on sporulation media commonly used, a suitable medium for conjugation and sporulation of S. rouxii was firstly investigated. A 5% NaCl Shoyu-koji extract agar was found to be most efficient. Next, we tried to get diploid strains by mass culture of two mating types on the conjugation medium, but several phenomena made this difficult: (i) zygotes quickly sporulated before budding; (ii) several zygotes showed terminal budding, but the buds could not grow into diploid cells, suggesting they would be heterocaryon; and (iii) a few zygotes lost their viability. After trying to isolate and cultivate a large number of zygotes in various combinations of crossing by micromanipulation, we fortunately recognized that large cells arose from some combinations. The analysis of ploidy suggested that the large cells would be diploid. Also, they showed sporulation of typical Saccharomyces, i.e., two to four spores in an unconjugated ascus. The diploid strains thus obtained were highly salt-tolerant and stable in liquid medium. Therefore, the procedure presented here would be effective for breeding salt-tolerant S. rouxii.<Conjugation, Genetic, Culture Media, Diploidy, Genetics, Microbial, Haploidy, Hybridization, Genetic, Saccharomyces
16049365<The transfer of hydrogen from C-24 to C-25 in ergosterol biosynthesis.<1. A convenient synthesis of 3-hydroxytrisnorlanost-8-en-24-al and its conversion into [24-(3)H]lanosterol and [26,27-(14)C(2)]lanosterol is described. 2. A method for the efficient incorporation of lanosterol into ergosterol by the whole cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is also described. 3. It is shown that in the biosynthesis of ergosterol from doubly labelled lanosterol the C-24 hydrogen atom of lanosterol is retained in ergosterol. 4. On the basis of unambiguous degradations it is shown that the C-alkylation step in ergosterol biosynthesis is accompanied by the migration of a hydrogen atom from C-24 to C-25. 5. The mechanism for the biosynthesis of the ergosterol side chain is presented. 6. Mechanisms of other C-alkylation reactions are also discussed.<Aldehydes, chemical synthesis, Alkylation, Carbon Isotopes, Hydrogen, metabolism, Saccharomyces, metabolism, Sternum, chemical synthesis, Sterols, metabolism, Tritium, Vitamin D, biosynthesis
16049367<Effect of glucocorticoid hormones on fatty acid mobilization and re-esterification in rat adipose tissue.<1. The effect of dexamethasone and cortisol on fatty acid mobilization and re-esterification has been studied in intact adipose tissue and isolated fat cells of the rat. 2. Dexamethasone added in vitro inhibited both the re-esterification of mobilized free fatty acids and the esterification of palmitate in the medium. 3. Under several conditions (low concentrations of dexamethasone, cortisol at a high concentration, with tissue from starved animals), steroid-induced release of free fatty acids could be accounted for by decreased re-esterification only, overall lipolytic activity remaining unmodified. At higher concentrations of dexamethasone, however, stimulation of lipolytic activity also occurred. 4. Decreased re-esterification produced by dexamethasone was observed in the total absence of glucose from the incubation medium. Further, dexamethasone stimulated the disappearance of prelabelled [(14)C]glycogen from the tissue. 5. The evidence presented suggests that mobilization of free fatty acids induced by glucocorticoid hormones under physiological conditions is primarily due to a decrease of the re-esterification rate rather than to lipase activation.<Adipose Tissue, drug effects, metabolism, Animals, Carbon Isotopes, Dexamethasone, pharmacology, Fatty Acids, Nonesterified, metabolism, Glycerol, metabolism, Glycogen, metabolism, Hydrocortisone, pharmacology, In Vitro Techniques, Male, Palmitic Acids, metabolism, Rats

It has in common with other tropomyosins A the method used for extracting it from adductor muscle, its solubility, facility of crystallization, ammonium sulphate range of precipitation, amino acid composition and behaviour when digested with trypsin. As a particular feature it exhibits an unusual low viscosity for this type of tropomyosin.

16049371<Substrate-specific inactivation of staphylococcal penicillinase.<1. The rate of hydrolysis of methicillin, cloxacillin and quinacillin by staphylococcal extracellular penicillinase decreases progressively with time. 2. The inactivation is prevented but not reversed by benzylpenicillin. 3. The rate of inactivation produced by quinacillin is minimal when the rate of hydrolysis is at a maximum. 4. Under certain conditions, partially inactivated enzyme can be reactivated. 5. Combination of the enzyme with antiserum, while permitting hydrolysis, prevents inactivation. 6.

16049382<Enzymic hydrolysis of the carbon-fluorine bond of alpha-D-glucosyl fluoride by rat intestinal mucosa. Localization of intestinal maltase.<1. alpha-d-Glucosyl fluoride was hydrolysed by an extract of rat intestinal mucosa. The pH optimum was 6.6 and the K(m) 0.4mm at 20 degrees . Activity was assayed by release of either glucose or fluoride. 2. The alpha-d-glucosyl fluoride-hydrolase activity of the extract was associated with both mutarotase and alpha-d-glucosidase activities. 3. Tris (5mm) inhibited both the alpha-d-glucosidase and alpha-d-glucosyl fluoride-hydrolase activities by 55% but did not inhibit mutarotase. The K(i) of tris for both enzyme activities was 2mm. 4. The extract did not hydrolyse melibiose and lactose. Mutarotase used both alpha-d-glucose and beta-l-arabinose as substrates but the glucosyl fluoride-hydrolase activity did not extend to beta-l-arabinosyl fluoride. 5. The thermal stability of alpha-d-glucosidase and alpha-d-glucosyl fluoride hydrolase was identical. Mutarotase was more thermolabile. 6. A preparation of the brush border of intestinal epithelial cells contained both alpha-d-glucosyl fluoride-hydrolase and alpha-d-glucosidase activities. In each precipitate and washing the ratio of the two activities was the same. All the mutarotase activity was in the first supernatant. 7. Agidex, a fungal amyloglucosidase, cleaved glucosyl fluoride in addition to maltose. Tris inhibited both activities and in each case the K(i) was 3mm. 8. The probable identity of alpha-d-glucosyl fluoride hydrolase with alpha-d-glucosidase is discussed and a possible mechanism for the reaction suggested. 9. Incubation of intestinal slices with alpha-d-glucosyl fluoride led to complete hydrolysis in 30min. The glucose rapidly entered the cell and was metabolized, leaving the fluoride in the incubation medium. This constitutes a further proof that the intestinal alpha-d-glucosidase, although on the brush border, is located outside the site of active transport of sugars.<Animals, Arabinose, metabolism, Biological Transport, Active, Fluorides, metabolism, Glucose, metabolism, Glucosidases, metabolism, Glycoside Hydrolases, metabolism, Glycosides, metabolism, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Intestinal Mucosa, enzymology, Isomerases, metabolism, Kinetics, Maltose, Rats
16049385<Effects of pH and temperature on the wild-type and a mutant form of Neurospora glutamate dehydrogenase.<1. We confirm the observation of Bürk (1965) that Neurospora crassa NADP-linked glutamate dehydrogenase normally exists in an inactive form below pH7.0 and in a fully active form above pH8.0 in either tris or orthophosphate buffer. At pH7.4 the enzyme is about half activated at 25 degrees . 2. The variety of the enzyme produced by the mutant am(2l) shows a similar behaviour except that the transition is shifted about one pH unit in the alkaline direction. 3. The am(2l) enzyme has previously been reported to be activated by brief warming to 30 degrees in phosphate buffer at pH8.0. The wild-type enzyme shows a similar effect at pH7.0. In tris buffer this effect is much less pronounced. 4. The am(2l) enzyme is extremely unstable at 47 degrees at pH7.0; its stability is somewhat greater at lower pH, and is markedly increased by increasing the pH in the range 7.0-8.7. The wild-type enzyme also shows an indication of a stability minimum at pH7.0, but a temperature of 60 degrees is needed for a measurable rate of inactivation. 5. The inactive form of the enzyme is much more subject to thermal irreversible denaturation than is the active form.<Glutamate Dehydrogenase, metabolism, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Molecular Biology, Mutation, Neurospora, enzymology, Protein Denaturation, Temperature

[16-(14)C]16-Epioestriol and [6,7-(3)H(2)]oestriol were incubated both simultaneously and separately at 40 degrees with hen liver homogenates obtained from birds in the laying stage. 2. Purification and identification of products was made by ether extraction, Girard separation, Celite partition and paper chromatography and crystallization to constant specific activity both with and without derivative formation. Percentage conversions of the radioactive 16-epioestriol and oestriol were calculated from these specific activities. 3. Oestriol yielded 16-epioestriol as early as 5min. after exposure of steroid to the tissue. No production of oestriol from 16-epioestriol was detectable in this time. 4. Considerably more 16-epioestriol was formed from oestriol than oestriol by the reverse reaction after 90min. of incubation. 5. 16-Oxo-oestradiol-17beta appeared in all cases to be the major identified intermediate in the interconversion of 16-epioestriol and oestriol.<Animals, Carbon Isotopes, Chickens, Chromatography, Paper, Crystallization, Estriol, analysis, metabolism, Estrogens, analysis, metabolism, Female, In Vitro Techniques, Liver, metabolism, Tritium
16049389<Changes in the chemical composition and the enzymic activities of hepatic microsomes of the chick embryo during development.<1. The values of the protein, RNA and phospholipid concentrations within the total microsomal fractions obtained from different stages of embryonic chick liver are compared. 2. Only the phospholipid content increases significantly with increasing developmental age. 3. The lack of membranes in the early stages of development and the relative constancy of RNA values during development suggests that some of the protein present at the early developmental stages is of a non-membranous non-ribosomal nature. 4. Glucose 6-phosphatase, adenosine triphosphatase, NADH(2)-cytochrome c reductase and diaphorase all increased in activity as development progressed. 5. Comparisons of submicrosomal fractions with respect to their protein, RNA and phospholipid content showed that in all embryonic stages fraction II (rough-membrane fraction) contained more than 60% of the proteins, RNA and phospholipid of the microsomal fraction. 6. Glucose 6-phosphatase was shown to be present predominantly in fraction II, whereas adenosine triphosphatase was present predominantly in fraction Iab (smooth-membrane fraction). 7. The significance of the differences between the smooth- and rough-microsomal fractions is discussed.<Animals, Chick Embryo, Endoplasmic Reticulum, embryology, Liver, analysis, cytology, embryology, enzymology, metabolism, Microscopy, Electron, Microsomes, enzymology, Phospholipids, analysis, metabolism, Proteins, analysis, metabolism, RNA, analysis, metabolism
16049390<Specificity of sweet-almond alpha-galactosidase.<1. The specificity of purified sweet-almond alpha-galactosidase has been investigated with 17 substrates. 2. Some of them exhibited inhibition at high substrate concentrations but others did not. Both substrate types were bound and hydrolysed at the same site on the enzyme. 3. The enzyme is specific for alpha-d-galactosides and beta-l-arabinosides. It did not hydrolyse beta-d-galactosides or alpha-d-glucosides. 4. Among galactosides the order of decreasing rates of enzymic hydrolysis was: aryl alpha-galactosides; sugars; alkyl alpha-galactosides. 5. All substituents in the aryl moiety of aryl alpha-galactosides enhanced V(max.), the electron-releasing (-sigma) groups being more effective than the electron-withdrawing (+sigma) groups. The substituent groups did not alter K(m) appreciably. 6.

The utilization of amino acids for gluconeogenesis by rat liver develops in postnatal life, reaching maximum activity at the fifth day. 2. The activity of aspartate transaminase shows a similar trend in postnatal development and the increased activity appears to be due to the soluble enzyme. 3. The activity of alanine transaminase is low in foetal and postnatal rat liver and increases in activity at about the twentieth day. 4.

16049395<C20 steroids. The metabolism of 3-hydroxy-19-nor[21-14C]pregna-1,3,5(10)-trien-20-one in the rabbit.<1. The metabolism of 3-hydroxy-19-norpregna-1,3,5(10)-trien-20-one, a possible product of the aromatization of progesterone or pregnenolone, has been studied. 2. After oral administration of this C(20) steroid as the 21-(14)C-labelled compound to two groups of rabbits, the excretion pattern of metabolites in the urine was examined. 3. At 14 days after administration, 3.3-6.5% of the radioactivity had appeared in the urine, 71-79% in the faeces and approx. 10% remained in the gut. 4. A metabolite, isolated from urine mainly as the unconjugated steroid, was identified as 19-norpregna-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,20alpha-diol and constituted 18.5-22% of the total urinary radioactivity. 5. A minor component of the urinary unconjugated steroids was identified as 19-norpregna-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17alpha,20alpha-triol. 6. A further 2-7.5% of the total urinary radioactivity, isolated only from the urinary sulphate fraction, was tentatively identified as an 18-oxygenated derivative of the administered steroid.<Animals, Carbon Isotopes, Chromatography, Chromatography, Paper, Feces, Female, Glucuronates, urine, Intestines, analysis, Microchemistry, Pregnanes, metabolism, Rabbits, Steroids, chemical synthesis, metabolism, urine, Sulfates, urine
16049399<The adenylate kinase of human plasma, erythrocytes and platelets in relation to the degradation of adenosine diphosphate in plasma.<1. Adenylate kinase (EC 2.7.4.3) has been shown to be present in human plasma obtained by conventional means and the adenylate-kinase activities of plasma and of lysed and intact human platelets and erythrocytes have been measured at 37 degrees by sensitive spectrophotometric methods. 2. The activities found in plasma ranged from 2.7 to 22.9mumoles of ADP formed/min./l. and in lysed platelets and lysed erythrocytes mean values of 0.79 and 12.0mumoles of ADP formed/min./10(9) cells respectively were found. Intact platelets and erythrocytes showed little or no activity. 3. The apparent K(m) of plasma adenylate kinase for ADP was found to be 1.4-1.6mm. 4. The adenylate-kinase activity of plasma was correlated with the free haemoglobin present and the larger part of the activity could be accounted for by haemolysis occurring either during the withdrawal of the blood or in vivo. 5. Aggregation of platelets by ADP, collagen fibres or thrombin released up to 16% of the platelet adenylate kinase into the suspending medium. 6. Measurement of the rate of breakdown of 1.6mum-ADP in plasma gave values of about 0.1mmu-mole/min./ml. This was not increased by addition of sufficient erythrocyte lysate to increase the activity of plasma adenylate kinase five to ten times. 7. It was concluded that the activity of adenylate kinase found in plasma, even after aggregation of the platelets, is insufficient to account for the rate of breakdown of low concentrations of ADP usually observed, and that another enzyme is responsible for this process.<Adenine Nucleotides, blood, Adenosine Triphosphate, blood, Blood Platelets, enzymology, Erythrocytes, enzymology, Hemolysis, Heparin, Humans, Kinetics, Phosphotransferases, blood
16049402<[35S]thiosulphate oxidation by rat liver mitochondria in the presence of glutathione.<1. Rat liver mitochondria incubated in oxygen with glutathione and [(35)S]-thiosulphate produced labelled sulphate. 2. Inner-labelled thiosulphate (S.(35)SO(3))(2-) was converted into [(35)S]sulphate more rapidly than outer-labelled thiosulphate ((35)S.SO(3))(2-). 3. Thiosulphate labelled in both sulphur atoms was formed during ((35)S.SO(3))(2-) oxidation; the outer sulphur atom before oxidation to sulphate was incorporated into the inner position. 4.

16049403<Utilization of endogenous lipid by the isolated perfused rat heart.<1. The lipids of the rat heart have been studied with regard to amount, classes present and fatty acid composition of free fatty acids, triglycerides and phospholipids. Myocardial lipid contained 300mumoles of total fatty acid/g. dry wt. of which only 2-4mumoles were free; the remainder was esterified, chiefly as phospholipid. Neutral esters, of which triglyceride was the principal form, made up 15% of the total fatty acids. 2. When normal hearts were perfused with a nutrient-free medium until exhaustion, the triglyceride concentration declined from 43 to 13mumoles/g. dry wt. The content of phospholipids, partial glycerides and cholesteryl esters did not change. When the lipids of the rat heart were labelled with [1-(14)C]palmitate before perfusion with non-nutrient medium, radioactivity disappeared from the triglyceride, diglyceride and free fatty acid fractions, but not from the phospholipid or other ester classes. 3. These experiments support the view that only a small fraction of the total cardiac lipid, principally triglycerides and to a smaller extent diglycerides, is available as a source of fuel in the absence of exogenous substrate.<Animals, Carbon Isotopes, Cholesterol, analysis, Chromatography, Gas, Fatty Acids, Nonesterified, analysis, Glycerides, analysis, In Vitro Techniques, Lipid Metabolism, Lipids, analysis, Male, Myocardium, analysis, metabolism, Palmitic Acids, metabolism, Perfusion, Phospholipids, analysis, Rats, Triglycerides, analysis
16049405<Hyaluronidase activity in lysosomes of bone tissue.<1. The distribution pattern of hyaluronidase in subcellular fractions of bone-tissue homogenates is closely similar to that reported by Vaes &amp; Jacques (1965b) for the other acid hydrolases of this tissue. The highest specific activity of hyaluronidase is also found in the light-mitochondrial fraction. 2. In cytoplasmic extracts of bone, about 60% of the activity of hyaluronidase is latent, and is unmasked by a number of treatments (digitonin, low osmotic pressure, freezing and thawing, Waring Blendor) that unmask the lysosomal beta-glucuronidase in a closely parallel manner. Low concentrations of Triton X-100 render a larger proportion of beta-glucuronidase than of hyaluronidase accessible to external substrates, but release the same proportion of both enzymes in unsedimentable form. 3. These results support the concept of an association of hyaluronidase with lysosomes in bone.<Animals, Animals, Newborn, Bone and Bones, cytology, enzymology, Glucuronidase, metabolism, Hyaluronoglucosaminidase, metabolism, In Vitro Techniques, Lysosomes, enzymology, Rats, Saponins, Surface-Active Agents
16049406<Electrophoretic properties of ovomucoid.<1. The nature of the electrophoretic heterogeneity of ovomucoid was investigated. Optimum resolution of the fractions on starch-gel electrophoresis occurred over a narrow range of pH and ionic strength. The pattern was not altered in the presence of 8m-urea but the bands were sharper. Ovomucoid-trypsin complex is stable at pH4.6 but dissociated in 6m-urea. 2. The two major fractions of ovomucoid were eluted from the gels. One of these was virtually free of sialic acid and the other, which contained 0.4mole of sialic acid/mole of protein, split into two components on electrophoresis after neuraminidase treatment. It was concluded that these two components, and likewise the two major fractions of ovomucoid, differ by a unit charge/mol. Differences in sialic acid content account for only part of the electrophoretic heterogeneity of ovomucoid.<Egg White, Electrophoresis, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Mucoproteins, analysis, Neuraminic Acids, analysis, Neuraminidase, Urea
16049407<Biosynthesis of the prenyl side chains of plastoquinone and related compounds in maize and barley shoots.<The incorporation of (14)C by etiolated maize and barley shoots exposed to light of (14)CO(2) and [2-(14)C]mevalonic acid into phylloquinone, plastoquinone, ubiquinone, alpha-tocopherolquinone and alpha-tocopherol was examined. In maize (the principal tissue studied) it was demonstrated that (14)C from [2-(14)C]mevalonic acid is incorporated into phylloquinone, plastoquinone and ubiquinone. alpha-Tocopherol and alpha-tocopherolquinone, although undoubtedly labelled from this substrate, were not purified completely. As expected, (14)C from (14)CO(2) was incorporated into all components examined. Ozonolytic degradation studies showed that (14)C from [2-(14)C]mevalonic acid was incorporated specifically into the prenyl side chains of plastoquinone and ubiquinone, and from this it was inferred that mevalonic acid can be regarded as the specific distal precursor to the prenyl portions of all terpenoid quinones occurring in plant tissues. From a comparison of the relative incorporation of (14)C from (14)CO(2) and [2-(14)C]mevalonic acid into the intra- and extra-chloroplastidic terpenoids evidence was obtained consistent with the tenet that the prenyl portions of the chloroplastidic quinones phylloquinone and plastoquinone, along with beta-carotene, are biosynthesized within the confines of the chloroplast, the side chain of the extraplastidic ubiquinone and phytosterols being synthesized elsewhere within the cell. The results obtained for the incorporation of (14)C from (14)CO(2) and [2-(14)C]mevalonic acid into alpha-tocopherol and alpha-tocopherolquinone were not readily interpretable with regard to the site of synthesis of these compounds.<Carbon Dioxide, metabolism, Carbon Isotopes, Chromatography, Chromatography, Thin Layer, Edible Grain, metabolism, radiation effects, Light, Mevalonic Acid, metabolism, Quinones, biosynthesis, Radiation Effects, Terpenes, biosynthesis, Ubiquinone, biosynthesis, Vitamin E, biosynthesis, Zea mays, metabolism, radiation effects
16049408<Metabolic activities of the isolated perfused rat kidney.<1. A technique for perfusing the isolated rat kidney is described. It is primarily designed for the study of renal metabolism but is also suitable for studying some aspects of the secretory function; this was normal with respect to minimal glucosuria. The glomerular filtration rate as measured by creatinine clearance was lower than in vivo and slowly decreased with time. 2. Gluconeogenesis from a variety of precursors was rapid and similar to that in kidney-cortex slices, in contrast with liver where the perfused organ is more effective than slices. Whereas the maximal rates of gluconeogenesis from glycerol and pyruvate were similar in liver and kidney, the rates from succinate, malate and fumarate were 14-20 times, and those from glutamate and aspartate about three times, as high in the kidney. 3. The oxygen consumption of the perfused organ was about twice that of cortex slices, presumably because of the secretory work done in the perfused organ but not in slices. 4. The rate of acetoacetate oxidation was about the same in the perfused organ and in slices but, because of the higher rate of oxygen consumption, the percentage contribution of acetoacetate to the fuel of respiration was lower in the perfused organ. The results suggest that acetoacetate can supply energy for the basal requirements and for gluconeogenesis but not for the secretory work. 5. Glutamine was formed at a high rate from glutamate and at a lower rate from aspartate. The high rates indicate that, in the rat, the kidney is a major source of body glutamine.<Acetoacetates, metabolism, Adenine Nucleotides, metabolism, Animals, Aspartic Acid, metabolism, Fumarates, metabolism, Glucagon, pharmacology, Gluconeogenesis, Glucose, metabolism, Glutamates, metabolism, Glycerol, metabolism, In Vitro Techniques, Kidney, metabolism, Lactates, metabolism, Ligases, Liver, metabolism, Malates, metabolism, Male, Oxygen Consumption, Perfusion, Pyruvates, metabolism, Rats, Serum Albumin, pharmacology, Succinates, metabolism, Urine
16049409<Nutrition and lysosomal activity. The influence of vitamin E deficiency and its duration on the stability of lysosomes in the kidneys of rats.<1. Experiments on rats were made to find whether the increased liability of the kidney-cortex tubules to autolysis post mortem, which is a well-established abnormality in vitamin E deficiency, can be correlated with changes in lysosomal activity. Parallel observations were made on the development of certain other abnormalities characteristic of avitaminosis E. 2. In rats killed after long periods (8-10 months) of subsistence on a standard vitamin E-deficient diet, containing lard, both the rate of kidney autolysis post mortem and the enzyme activity of lysosome preparations from the fresh tissues were much greater than in controls. A greater percentage difference was usually found in the ;free' enzyme fraction than in ;bound' or ;total' activity. 3. In rats killed after graded periods (3-8 months) of deficiency, two abnormalities (decreased resistance of the erythrocytes to haemolysis, and brown discoloration of the uterus) were already evident at a stage (3-4 months) when the liability to rapid kidney autolysis had not begun. At this point the enzymic activity of kidney extracts differed little between deficient animals and controls given alpha-tocopherol. As the duration of deficiency advanced, parallel increases occurred in the rate of kidney autolysis and in lysosomal instability. 4. When cod-liver oil, rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids but freed from vitamin A, was substituted for lard in the diet, the time (1(1/2) months) required for the inducement of both rapid kidney autolysis and decreased lysosomal stability was greatly shortened. The time for the inducement of brown discoloration of the uterus was not shortened and the kidney abnormalities appeared while the uterus was still normal. 5. Confirmation was thus obtained for the view that the various tissues of the rat respond differently to the relationship between the adequacy of the vitamin E status and the intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids. The kidney-cortex tubules, as evidenced by autolysis post mortem and the corresponding decrease in lysosomal stability, may be classed among those tissues that are most sensitive to the effect of high intakes of polyunsaturated acids.<Animals, Dietary Fats, pharmacology, Female, Fish Oils, pharmacology, Kidney, enzymology, Lysosomes, enzymology, Rats, Vitamin E Deficiency, enzymology
16049670<Electron microscopic and biochemical study of lipoprotein synthesis in the isolated perfused rat liver.<The isolated perfused rat liver was used to study the 300-800 A electron-opaque bodies which had previously been described in the liver cell Golgi apparatus, smooth endoplasmic reticulum, and space of Disse. When the perfusion medium was enriched with linoleate, the number and electron opacity of these particles increased markedly. Sequential biopsies showed that they appeared first in the smooth surfaced terminal ends of the rough reticulum, the smooth endoplasmic reticulum proper, and the Golgi apparatus and later in the space of Disse. After 60 min of perfusion, particles of the same size and shape as those in the liver cells could be isolated in large numbers from the d &lt; 1.006 fraction of the perfusate. Control livers perfused with an identical medium but without linoleate did not show these changes. Puromycin markedly depressed the production of 300-800 A particles by livers perfused with an oleate-rich medium; however, it did not interfere with the formation of large cytoplasmic droplets of neutral fat. In keeping with these findings, puromycin blocked the incorporation of oleate-(14)C into lipoprotein triglyceride isolated from the perfusate, but did not interfere with the appearance of the labeled fatty acid in tissue triglyceride. Puromycin also blocked the incorporation of leucine-(3)H into both tissue protein and perfusate lipoprotein. We concluded that the 300-800 A particles observed are, in all likelihood, very low density lipoproteins and that their formation is blocked by puromycin, presumably through interference with the synthesis of their apoprotein.<Animals, Chemotherapy, Cancer, Regional Perfusion, Cytoplasmic Granules, Endoplasmic Reticulum, Fatty Acids, metabolism, Golgi Apparatus, Leucine, metabolism, Linoleic Acids, pharmacology, Lipoproteins, biosynthesis, Liver, cytology, drug effects, metabolism, Microscopy, Electron, Mitochondria, Liver, Oleic Acids, metabolism, Puromycin, pharmacology, Rats
16049671<Amino acid composition of the proteins from chylomicrons and human serum lipoproteins.<By a combination of polyanion precipitation and ultracentrifugation, chylomicrons, very low density, low density, and high density lipoproteins have been isolated from human serum as discrete classes free from contamination with any other major class of lipoprotein or protein. After removal of the lipid, the proteins from each class were hydrolyzed and their amino acid compositions were determined by use of the amino acid analyzer. Application of the "t" test to the concentrations of amino acid residues showed that the amino acid composition of the proteins from each of these lipoprotein classes differs significantly from class to class. However, when the logarithms of the moles of amino acid residues are plotted, there are similarities in the amino acid "profiles" between the chylomicrons and high density lipoproteins on the one hand, and between the very low density and low density lipoproteins on the other. The differences in amino acid composition between the lipoproteins suggest that any metabolic interconversions between them probably do not occur by simple lipolysis.<Amino Acids, analysis, Blood Protein Electrophoresis, Cholesterol, analysis, Chylomicrons, analysis, Humans, Immunoelectrophoresis, Lipoproteins, analysis, metabolism, Male, Phospholipids, analysis, Proteins, analysis, Triglycerides, analysis, Ultracentrifugation
16049672<Molecular weight distributions of milk fat triglycerides from seven species.<The triglyceride compositions of the milk fats of man, dog, guinea pig, cow, sheep, goat, and horse were compared by gas-liquid chromatography of the intact triglycerides and of the butyl esters of the component fatty acids. The milk fats of man, dog, and guinea pig, which were largely made up of long-chain fatty acids, showed a common pattern with major contributions made by the glycerides with 48-54 acyl carbon atoms. The milk fats of cow, sheep, and goat, which were rich in short-chain acids, showed significant proportions of triglycerides with 28-54 acyl carbon atoms. Horse milk, which contains large amounts of medium-chain fatty acids, gave a characteristic triglyceride pattern in the 26-54 carbon atoms range. The experimentally determined distributions of the molecular weights of the triglycerides of all milk fats deviated significantly from the distributions predicted by random association of the fatty acids from a single pool. The data suggest that in all species the milk fat may be formed by a partial resynthesis of preformed glycerides.<Animals, Cattle, Chromatography, Gas, Chromatography, Thin Layer, Dietary Fats, analysis, Dogs, Fatty Acids, analysis, Food Analysis, Goats, Guinea Pigs, Horses, Humans, Milk, chemistry, Milk, Human, chemistry, Molecular Weight, Sheep, Triglycerides, analysis
16049673<Hydrolysis of phospholipids by a lysosomal enzyme.<The phospholipid-hydrolyzing activity of rat liver lysosomes has been studied. These lysosomes contain a phospholipase that cleaves both fatty acid ester linkages of lecithin and of phosphatidyl ethanolamine and releases free fatty acids from both positional isomers of lysolecithin. The enzyme does not require calcium for maximum activity, and is inhibited by diethyl ether and sodium deoxycholate. Mercuric ions and cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide also inhibit the hydrolysis. Compared with lipase activity, this enzyme is relatively stable to heat. The specific activity of the hydrolysis of lecithin by the lysosomal enzyme is considerably higher than those reported for mitochondrial and microsomal phospholipases. The enzyme resembles other hydrolases of the lysosome in that it has an acid pH optimum (pH 4.5). This enzymic activity is present in both the lysosomal soluble enzyme fraction and in the lysosomal membrane fraction. The enzyme may participate in the intracellular digestion of mitochondria that is carried out by the intact lysosome in vivo. Localized inflammation and changes in vascular permeability following tissue damage could be catalyzed by this phospholipase.<Animals, Calcium, pharmacology, Carbon Isotopes, Fatty Acids, Inflammation, metabolism, Liver, enzymology, Lysophosphatidylcholines, metabolism, Lysosomes, enzymology, Mercury, pharmacology, Mitochondria, enzymology, Phosphatidylcholines, metabolism, Phosphatidylethanolamines, metabolism, Phospholipases, antagonists &amp; inhibitors, metabolism, Phospholipids, metabolism, Rats
16049674<Studies in the biosynthesis of hepatic and biliary lecithins.<Male rats with biliary cannulae were injected with linoleate-1-(14)C, stearate-1-(14)C, palmitate-9-10-(3)H, phosphate-(32)P, l-methionine-methyl-(14)C, and choline-methyl-(3)H in various combinations and the incorporation of these isotopes into the phospholipids of liver, bile, and plasma was determined for 1-4 hr. The results summarized below favor the view (a) that exchange of saturated fatty acids plays a role in the formation of lecithins; (b) that the unsaturated fatty acids do not undergo significant exchange and determine the pathway of biosynthesis of lecithins; and (c) that there is either more than one pool of CDP-choline in liver or a pathway of biosynthesis of lecithin from choline not involving CDP-choline as an intermediate. Linoleoyl lecithin of liver attained higher specific activity with respect to phosphate-(32)P and choline-methyl-(3)H than did arachidonoyl lecithin. Lecithin in bile attained higher specific activities with respect to phosphate-(32)P, choline-methyl-(3)H, and linoleate-1-(14)C than the corresponding hepatic lecithins. Stearate-1-(14)C and palmitate-9-10-(3)H attained highest specific activities in the hepatic lecithin fraction rich in arachidonic acid. The specific activity of hepatic phosphatidyl ethanolamine was lower with respect to saturated fatty acids, but much higher with respect to (32)P than any lecithin. The ratio of specific activity of (3)H in methyl groups from choline to (14)C in methyl groups from methionine in hepatic sphingomyelin was lower than in hepatic linoleoyl lecithin.<Animals, Bile, chemistry, Carbon Isotopes, Choline, metabolism, Fatty Acids, analysis, Linoleic Acids, metabolism, Liver, chemistry, metabolism, Methionine, metabolism, Palmitic Acids, metabolism, Phosphates, metabolism, Phosphatidylcholines, analysis, biosynthesis, Phosphatidylethanolamines, metabolism, Phosphorus Isotopes, Rats, Stearic Acids, metabolism
16049675<Characterization and identification of glyceryl ether diesters present in tumor cells.<The previously unidentified neutral lipid present in tumor tissues has been isolated from Ehrlich ascites cells and unequivocally identified as a lipid class of glyceryl ether diesters containing various degrees of unsaturation, and ranging in approximate molecular weight from 760 to 990. The glyceryl ether diester fraction was shown to be free from neutral plasmalogens (glyceryl diacyl alk-1'-enyl ethers). The tumor lipid was subjected to saponification, transesterification, and lithium aluminum hydride reduction. The glyceryl monoethers that resulted from deacylation were the 1-isomers ranging in hydrocarbon chain length from C(12) to C(24). The predominant glyceryl ethers were the hexadecyl (49%), octadecyl (21%), and octadecenyl (14%) derivatives. Saturated and mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids ranging in chain length from C(12) to C(24) carbon atoms were esterified to the glyceryl monoether. Gas-liquid chromatography, thin-layer chromatography, and nuclear magnetic resonance and infrared spectroscopy were used to characterize and identify the intact tumor lipid and its derived products.<Animals, Carcinoma, Ehrlich Tumor, Chromatography, Gas, Chromatography, Thin Layer, Ethers, analysis, Glycerides, analysis, Lipids, analysis, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Mice, Spectrum Analysis
16049676<Separation and size determination of human serum lipoproteins by agarose gel filtration.<A method is described for the separation of the three major classes of human serum lipoproteins by gel filtration on columns of 4 and 6% agarose gel. After calibration of the columns, the elution volumes of the lipoproteins were used to calculate the molecular sizes and molecular weights of these macromolecules. The technique was employed to demonstrate aggregation of low density lipoprotein following partial delipidation, partial proteolysis, or mild heat denaturation. Agarose gel filtration shows promise as a useful method for the isolation, purification, and characterization of lipoproteins.<Chemical Phenomena, Chemistry, Chromatography, Gel, Humans, Lipoproteins, analysis, Molecular Weight, Polysaccharides, Ultracentrifugation

16049853<Fractionation of the chymotryptic precipitate of Bombyx mori silk fibroin.<1. A solution of Bombyx mori silk fibroin was digested with chymotrypsin. Amino acid analyses of the chymotryptic precipitate showed in addition to the main constituents Gly, Ala, Ser and Tyr, very small amounts of Lys, His, Arg, Asp, Thr, Glu, Pro, Cys, Val, Met, Ile, Leu, Phe and Trp. 2. A stable solution of the chymotryptic precipitate in 6m-urea was obtained by dialysing a solution in 50% (w/v) lithium thiocyanate against 6m-urea. 3. The dinitrophenylated chymotryptic precipitate in 6m-urea was fractionated by gel filtration and by ion-exchange chromatography. On Dowex 1 (X2), a main fraction I(d) and three further fractions with different amino acid compositions and molecular weights were obtained. 4. Specific rearrangement and fission of the bonds involving the serine nitrogen atoms of fraction I(d) and fractionation of the resulting mixture by gel filtration yielded five fractions. Two of these fractions had the compositions DNP-Ser-(Gly(6),Ala(4),Ser) and DNP-Ser-(Gly(4),Ala(2) or Ala(3),Ser) and are presumably double repeating units according to the proposed formula of Lucas, Shaw &amp; Smith (1957), namely [Ser-Gly-(Ala-Gly)(n)](2), for n values of 2 and 1 respectively.<Amino Acids, analysis, Animals, Bombyx, Chromatography, Gel, Chromatography, Ion Exchange, Chymotrypsin, metabolism, Dialysis, Dinitrophenols, Electrophoresis, Fibroins, metabolism, Molecular Weight, Ultracentrifugation, Urea
16049854<Turnover of mitochondrial components of normal and essential fatty acid-deficient rats.<1. Essential fatty acid (EFA)-deficient and control rats were injected intraperitoneally with [(32)P]phosphate, l-[(35)S]methionine and [2-(14)C]acetate. The animals were killed at various time-intervals after injection and their liver mitochondria fractionated into soluble protein, insoluble protein, and lipid. 2. The (35)S was assayed in the protein fractions and (32)P and (14)C were assayed in the lipid fraction. Curves of log (specific activity) plotted against time were prepared for the different fractions. 3. There was no significant difference between the insoluble protein results for control and EFA-deficient animals, both sets of results indicating the presence of a single component of half-life 9 days. 4. There was no significant difference between the soluble protein results for the two sets of animals and both sets of results indicated the presence of at least two components. 5. The [(32)P]-phospholipid results indicate that in the control animals the liver mitochondrial phospholipids contain components of half-life 1.6 and 10 days whereas the mitochondrial phospholipids of the EFA-deficient animals contain components of half-life 3 and 29 days. 6. The specific activity of mitochondrial [(14)C]phospholipid initially fell rapidly in both groups of animals, but after 17 days there was no further significant decrease. A fast component with maximum half-life 2-4 days was clearly demonstrated for both groups of animals. Whether or not these results also indicate the presence of a very long-lived mitochondrial phospholipid is discussed.<Acetates, metabolism, Animals, Carbon Isotopes, Deficiency Diseases, metabolism, Fatty Acids, Essential, pharmacology, Injections, Intraperitoneal, Methionine, metabolism, Mitochondria, metabolism, Phosphates, metabolism, Phospholipids, metabolism, Phosphorus Isotopes, Proteins, analysis, Rats, Solubility, Sulfur Isotopes
16049855<Kinetic studies of the induction of nitrate reductase and cytochrome c reductase in the fungus Aspergillus nidulans.<In an earlier paper (Cove, 1966) it was reported that the kinetics of appearance of nitrate reductase (NADPH-nitrate oxidoreductase, EC 1.6.6.3) on the addition of nitrate to a growing culture of Aspergillus nidulans were different in certain respects from those found for many Escherichia coli enzymes. When urea is used as an initial nitrogen source, a further difference is found: enzyme synthesis is no longer continuous. This interruption of synthesis does not appear to be due to synchronous cell division in the culture, nor to be due to accumulation of ammonia. Fluctuations in the intracellular concentration of nitrate, though appearing to be partly responsible for the discontinuity of enzyme syntheses, cannot account for all the observations. Two related hypotheses are put forward to explain this discontinuity of synthesis; each suggests that nitrate reductase is intimately concerned with its own synthesis. One possibility is that the enzyme when it is not in the form of a complex with nitrate is a co-repressor of its own synthesis, and the other that the enzyme is its own repressor.<Aspergillus, enzymology, Cytochromes, metabolism, Enzyme Induction, Enzyme Repression, Kinetics, Nitrates, metabolism, Oxidoreductases, biosynthesis
16049856<Characterization and metabolism of ovine foetal lipids.<1. Total phospholipid concentrations in liver, kidney and brain of the 140-day ovine foetus were only half of those in comparable maternal tissues. 2. Phosphatidylcholine was the predominant phospholipid in all foetal tissues examined. The most striking difference between foetal and maternal tissues in individual phospholipids was in the heart; foetal heart contained more ethanolamine plasmalogen than choline plasmalogen, whereas in adult tissue the concentration of these was reversed. Sphingomyelin content of foetal brain was only one-sixth of that of maternal brain tissue. 3. Oleic acid (18:1) was the predominant acid in the phospholipid extracted from foetal tissues, except in brain where palmitic acid (16:0) was slightly higher. In phospholipids from adult tissues there was a higher proportion of unsaturated fatty acids (linoleic acid, 18:2, and linolenic acid, 18:3) and a correspondingly lower proportion of oleic acid (18:1). The distribution of fatty acids in the neutral lipid fraction of foetal and maternal tissues was very similar; oleic acid (18:1) was generally the principal component. 4. (14)C derived from [U-(14)C]-glucose and [U-(14)C]fructose infused into the foetal circulation in utero was incorporated into the neutral lipids and phospholipids of heart, liver, kidney, brain and adipose tissue. 5. Phospholipid analysis revealed that the specific activity of phosphatidic acid was higher in liver than in other tissues. The specific activity of phosphatidylethanolamine was less than that of phosphatidylcholine in heart, but in other tissues they were about the same. The specific activities of phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidic acid in brain were very similar and were higher than the other components. The specific activity of phosphatidylserine was highest in liver and brown fat. 6. The pattern of incorporation of (14)C derived from [(14)C]glucose and [(14)C]fructose into foetal neutral lipids was similar. Diglyceride accounted for most of the radioactivity in brain, whereas triglyceride had more label in heart, liver, kidney and fat.<Animals, Brain Chemistry, Carbon Isotopes, Fats, Unsaturated, analysis, Fatty Acids, analysis, Female, Fetus, metabolism, Hexoses, metabolism, Infusions, Parenteral, Kidney, analysis, Lipid Metabolism, Liver, analysis, Myocardium, analysis, Phospholipids, analysis, Pregnancy, Pregnancy, Animal, Sheep
16049857<New evidence for the structure of myxinol.<1. Preliminary spectroscopic examination of a second component of hagfish bile salts suggested that it might be 3beta,7alpha,26(27)-trihydroxy-5alpha-cholestane. 2. Impure reduction products of the 3beta,26(27)-dihydroxycholestane-7,16-dione previously made from myxinol disulphate appeared also to have the 5alpha-configuration. 3. Infrared, nuclear-magnetic-resonance and mass-spectrographic as well as optical-rotatory-dispersion measurements on 3beta,26(27)-dihydroxycholestane-7,16-dione showed that it was a 5alpha-compound. 4. Myxinol is thus 3beta,7alpha,16alpha,26(27)-tetrahydroxy-5alpha-cholestane; new nuclear-magnetic-resonance measurements on myxinol tetra-acetate at higher resolution confirm this structure.<Animals, Bile Acids and Salts, analysis, Fishes, Infrared Rays, Spectrum Analysis

Implantation of diethylstilboestrol pellets into adult male rats brings about similar biochemical changes in the nucleic acid and protein metabolism to castration. 2. The avidity of the prostate for labelled diethylstilboestrol was greater than that of the other organs examined. 3. Uptake of labelled diethylstilboestrol and testosterone into the nuclei of the rat prostate is greater in castrated rats than in controls. 4.

16049859<The isolation of purified neurosecretory granules from bovine pituitary posterior lobes. Comparison of granule protein constituents with those of neurophysin.<1. A procedure for the isolation of highly purified neurosecretory granules from the posterior lobe of the bovine pituitary gland is described. The preparation was free from contamination by the mitochondrial enzyme succinate dehydrogenase and the lysosomal enzyme cathepsin. 2. The biological activities of the neurosecretory granules were measured: the oxytocic activity was 11.61+/-1.30units and the pressor activity was 10.73+/-1.74units/mg. of protein. 3. A lysate of the isolated granules was shown to contain two proteins that appear to be identical with two of the constituents of neurophysin. 4. The constituents of neurophysin not present in neurosecretory granules could not be detected in any other subcellular fraction. It is suggested that the components of neurophysin not present in the neurosecretory granules arise as a result of the degradation of the two granular proteins.<Animals, Biological Assay, Cathepsins, pharmacology, Cattle, Centrifugation, Density Gradient, Chromatography, Electrophoresis, Female, Male, Microscopy, Electron, Neurosecretion, Oxytocin, Pituitary Gland, Posterior, metabolism, Proteins, analysis, Succinate Dehydrogenase, pharmacology, Vasopressins

Analytical results agree with earlier physical measurements indicating a molecular weight of about 23000. 3. Mild acid hydrolysis and treatment with neuraminidase showed that fucose and sialic acid occupy terminal positions on oligosaccharide chains. 4. Treatment of the sialic acid-free glycoprotein with beta-galactosidase showed that much of the galactose occupies a sub-terminal location in the intact glycoprotein. 5. The polypeptide chain is rich in aspartic acid, glutamic acid, serine, threonine and glycine, and has no detectable free terminal amino group. 6. Glycopeptides were studied after proteolytic digestion. 7. It is considered that the carbohydrate moiety is highly branched and is probably linked by an acid- and alkali-stable glycosylamine bond involving aspartic acid.<Animals, Bone and Bones, analysis, Cattle, Chromatography, Paper, Electrophoresis, Fucose, analysis, Galactosidases, metabolism, Glycoproteins, analysis, Molecular Weight, Neuraminic Acids, analysis, Neuraminidase, metabolism, Oligosaccharides, analysis, Peptides, analysis, Spectrum Analysis

Adenosine 3',5'-(cyclic)-monophosphate (3',5'-AMP) stimulates the synthesis of progestational steroids by rabbit ovarian tissue in vitro. 2. Other adenosine phosphates fail to increase steroidogenesis. 3. The ratio of 20alpha-hydroxypregn-4-en-3-one to progesterone, the maximal response of the tissue, and the responses of separated corpora lutea and interstitial tissue produced by luteinizing hormone are closely paralleled by 3',5'-AMP. 4. In tissues maximally stimulated by luteinizing hormone, 3',5'-AMP fails to produce an additional response. 5. The addition of theophylline, an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase, potentiates the effects of 3',5'-AMP and also luteinizing hormone. 6. The results obtained suggest that 3',5'-AMP is a mediator of the action of luteinizing hormone on progestational steroid synthesis by rabbit ovarian tissue.<Adenine Nucleotides, pharmacology, Animals, Chromatography, Thin Layer, Female, In Vitro Techniques, Luteinizing Hormone, pharmacology, Ovary, drug effects, Progestins, biosynthesis, Rabbits, Theophylline, pharmacology

As a result of the mutation of Staphylococcus aureus by pyrithiamine, deletion of the enzyme thiaminokinase in the system occurs. Some properties of thiaminokinase including the effects of pH, pyrophosphate donor nucleotides and metal ions on the enzyme in the parent S. aureus have been studied. Cell-free extract from mutant strain has been studied under similar conditions and thiaminokinase activity was found to be absent. Addition of thiamine (10mug./ml.) to the medium containing pyrithiamine (required for the growth of the mutant strain) did not give rise to thiaminokinase activity in the mutant bacteria. 2. The parent and the mutant strains of S. aureus have been studied for the fermentative production of acetylmethylcarbinol (3-hydroxybutan-2-one) and the mutant strain did not produce acetylmethylcarbinol under the conditions used.<Cell-Free System, Fermentation, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Metals, pharmacology, Mutation, drug effects, Phosphotransferases, antagonists &amp; inhibitors, Staphylococcus, enzymology, Thiamine, metabolism, Thiamine Pyrophosphate, pharmacology
16049920<The use of choline acetyltransferase for measuring the synthesis of acetyl-coenzyme A and its release from brain mitochondria.<1. A method for measuring small amounts of acetyl-CoA synthesized in subcellular fractions of the brain from pyruvate and released from particles into the incubation medium has been developed by using placental choline acetyltransferase and choline in the incubation medium to transform acetyl-CoA into acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is measured by biological assay. Optimum conditions of incubation are described. 2. With fresh mitochondria, a decrease of acetyl-CoA output into the medium is observed in the presence of ATP or ADP, and an increase in the presence of calcium chloride or 2,4-dinitrophenol. Fluorocitrate and malonate have little or no effect. 3. After the mitochondria had been treated with ether, the release of acetyl-CoA into the medium is much larger; presumably, nearly all acetyl-CoA synthesized is then released and transformed into acetylcholine under the conditions used. The release of acetyl-CoA is diminished in the presence of Krebs-cycle intermediates and ADP. 4. Of all subcellular fractions, the highest acetyl-CoA production from pyruvate is found in the crude mitochondria; rates up to 51 mumoles of acetyl-CoA/g. of original tissue/hr. are observed in ether-treated samples. 5. The activities of acetyl-CoA synthetase and ATP citrate lyase found in homogenates and nerve-ending fractions of brain tissue are considerably lower than those of pyruvate oxidase complex and choline acetyltransferase. 6. The bearing of some of the findings on the question of the source of acetyl radicals for the synthesis of acetylcholine in vivo is discussed.<Acetylcholine, biosynthesis, Acyltransferases, metabolism, Adenine Nucleotides, pharmacology, Animals, Antimetabolites, pharmacology, Biological Assay, Brain Chemistry, drug effects, Choline, metabolism, Citric Acid Cycle, Coenzyme A, analysis, Ethers, pharmacology, Mitochondria, metabolism, Rabbits, Sheep
16049921<The hepatotoxic action of allyl formate.<The hepatotoxic action of allyl formate on rat liver has been investigated. Biochemical changes can be detected in the liver cell many hours before the histological changes and it would appear that the toxin has a direct action on the liver parenchymal cell. The results suggest that allyl formate is not the toxic agent but that it is converted via allyl alcohol into acrolein. This reaction requires the presence of alcohol dehydrogenase. Histochemical studies have shown that this enzyme is localized in the periportal region of the liver lobule, and may explain why allyl formate solely produces a periportal necrosis. As glutathione and 1,4-dithiothreitol protect against the early biochemical changes produced by the poison, it is probable that acrolein alkylates proteins and nucleic acids.<Alcohol Oxidoreductases, metabolism, Aldehydes, toxicity, Animals, Carbon Isotopes, Formates, toxicity, Glutathione, pharmacology, Histocytochemistry, Leucine, metabolism, Liver, drug effects, Male, Mitochondria, metabolism, Rats
16049922<The interaction of alpha-chymotrypsin with isosteric substrates of different charge type.<1. The synthesis of three substrates of alpha-chymotrypsin of closely similar steric requirements but different charge type is reported. 2. The interaction of these compounds [SS-dimethyl-(l-3-carboxymethyl-3-acetamido)propyl sulphonium iodide, l-2-acetamido-5-methylhexanoic acid methyl ester and N-acetyl-l-glutamic acid alpha-methyl ester] with alpha-chymotrypsin has been studied. 3. For the charged substrates, values of k(0) are two orders of magnitude smaller than, and values of K(m) two orders of magnitude larger than, the corresponding values for the uncharged isostere. 4. The results are interpreted in terms of the known specificity of the enzyme, and the relationship between binding and kinetic specificities is discussed.<Binding Sites, Chemical Phenomena, Chemistry, Physical, Chymotrypsin, metabolism, Kinetics, Models, Chemical

The incorporation of [2-(14)C,(5R)-5-(3)H(1)]mevalonic acid and [2-(14)C,5-(3)H(2)]-mevalonic acid into phytoene, phytofluene, zeta-carotene, neurosporene, alpha-, beta-, gamma- and delta-carotene and lycopene by slices of fruit from two tomato mutants (delta and tangerine) and into alpha- and beta-carotene by bean leaves has been studied. 2. In the formation of phytoene, all the pro-R-hydrogen atoms from C-5 of mevalonic acid are retained whereas two pro-S-hydrogen atoms are lost. 3. Possible mechanisms for the condensation of two molecules of all-trans-geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate are outlined. 4. In each dehydrogenation step from phytoene to the fully unsaturated carotenes, one pro-R-hydrogen atom from C-5 of mevalonic acid is lost, indicating that the sequential dehydrogenation is stereospecific and in the same sense at each step.<Binding Sites, Carbon Isotopes, Carotenoids, biosynthesis, Fruit, Mevalonic Acid, metabolism, Mutation, Plants, Edible, metabolism, Tritium
16049924<Multiple forms of glucose-adenosine triphosphate phosphotransferase in rat mammary gland.<Measurements have been made of the total hexokinase activity and of the relative amounts of types I and II hexokinase in rat mammary gland and at different stages of the lactation cycle. The total hexokinase activity increased during lactation, that of type II increasing to a greater extent than that of type I; the type II/type I activity ratio rose from a pregnancy value of about 1 to a mid-lactation value of 3, returning to 1 on involution. The changes in type II hexokinase activity during the lactation cycle parallel the changes in the insulin sensitivity of mammary-gland tissue. A study of the effect of alloxan-diabetes on mammary-gland hexokinase during the mid-lactation period revealed that, although the total glucose-phosphorylating capacity of the mammary gland was almost unchanged, the relative contributions of type I and type II hexokinases altered, decreasing the type II/type I activity ratio to about 1.<Animals, Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental, complications, Electrophoresis, Female, Glucokinase, metabolism, Hexokinase, metabolism, Lactation, Mammary Glands, Animal, enzymology, Oxidative Phosphorylation, Pregnancy, Pregnancy, Animal, Rats, Spectrophotometry
16049925<A direct effect of growth hormone on the incorporation of precursors into proteins and nucleic acids of perfused rat liver.<1. The livers of rats were perfused in situ. When the amino acid concentration in the perfusing medium was that present in rat plasma, the addition of growth hormone to the medium stimulated the incorporation of labelled amino acids into liver protein only marginally and not to a statistically significant extent. When, however, the amino acid concentration was raised to three times that present in rat plasma, growth hormone significantly and substantially stimulated amino acid incorporation into protein within 30min. of perfusion of normal rat liver. 2. A significant effect of growth hormone on labelling of normal rat-liver protein was seen with concentrations not much greater than those reported to be present in rat plasma. 3. The labelling of nucleic acids of normal and hypophysectomized rat liver by [(3)H]orotic acid was enhanced by addition of growth hormone to the perfusing medium when normal concentrations of amino acids were used. 4. At elevated concentrations of amino acids, growth hormone stimulated labelling of nucleic acids of hypophysectomized rat liver at 30 and 60min. of perfusion. Under these conditions, nucleic acids of normal rats were labelled to about the same extent in control and hormone-treated livers at 30min. and, because of a fall in the radioactivity of the control livers, there was more labelled nucleic acids in growth-hormone-treated livers at 60min. than in the control livers. 5. Growth hormone, unlike insulin, had no inhibitory effect on the release of glucose by the perfused liver. 6. It is concluded that growth hormone can stimulate the incorporation of precursor into proteins and nucleic acids of liver directly and without the mediation of other organs or of insulin.<Animals, Carbon Isotopes, Cats, Female, Growth Hormone, pharmacology, Hypophysectomy, Insulin, pharmacology, Leucine, metabolism, Liver, drug effects, Male, Nucleic Acids, metabolism, Orotic Acid, metabolism, Perfusion, Phenylalanine, metabolism, Protein Biosynthesis, Rats
16049926<Transport of glucose and galactose in kidney-cortex cells.<1. The aerobic transport of d-glucose and d-galactose in rabbit kidney tissue at 25 degrees was studied. 2. In slices forming glucose from added substrates an accumulation of glucose against its concentration gradient was found. The apparent ratio of intracellular ([S](i)) and extracellular ([S](o)) glucose concentrations was increased by 0.4mm-phlorrhizin and 0.3mm-ouabain. 3. Slices and isolated renal tubules actively accumulated glucose from the saline; the apparent [S](i)/[S](o) fell below 1.0 only at [S](o) higher than 0.5mm. 4. The rate of glucose oxidation by slices was characterized by the following parameters: K(m) 1.16mm; V(max.) 4.5mumoles/g. wet wt./hr. 5. The active accumulation of glucose from the saline was decreased by 0.1mm-2,4-dinitrophenol, 0.4mm-phlorrhizin and by the absence of external Na(+). 6. The kinetic parameters of galactose entry into the cells were: K(m) 1.5mm; V(max) 10mumoles/g. wet wt./hr. 7. The efflux kinetics from slices indicated two intracellular compartments for d-galactose. The galactose efflux was greatly diminished at 0 degrees , was inhibited by 0.4mm-phlorrhizin, but was insensitive to ouabain. 8. The following mechanism of glucose and galactose transport in renal tubular cells is suggested: (a) at the tubular membrane, these sugars are actively transported into the cells by a metabolically- and Na(+)-dependent phlorrhizin-sensitive mechanism; (b) at the basal cell membrane, these sugars are transported in accordance with their concentration gradient by a phlorrhizin-sensitive Na(+)-independent facilitated diffusion. The steady-state intracellular sugar concentration is determined by the kinetic parameters of active entry, passive outflow and intracellular utilization.<Animals, Biological Transport, Active, drug effects, Carbon Isotopes, Cell Membrane Permeability, drug effects, Dinitrophenols, pharmacology, Galactose, metabolism, Glucose, metabolism, In Vitro Techniques, Kidney Tubules, metabolism, Kinetics, Ouabain, pharmacology, Phlorhizin, pharmacology, Rabbits, Sodium, pharmacology
16049927<Transport of monosaccharides in kidney-cortex cells.<1. The aerobic accumulation of various monosaccharides in slices of rabbit kidney cortex at 25 degrees was studied. 2. d-Fructose and alpha-methyl d-glucoside were readily accumulated against their concentration gradient by a phlorrhizin-sensitive Na(+)-dependent active transport. In the absence of external Na(+) the maximal rate of alpha-methyl glucoside transport was decreased tenfold, the K(m) of entry into the cells (8.2mm) not being affected. Phlorrhizin and d-galactose inhibited the entry of alpha-methyl glucoside also in the absence of external Na(+). 3. d-Xylose, 6-deoxy-d-glucose and 6-deoxy-d-galactose were poorly accumulated ([S](i)/[S](o) ratios slightly above 1.0); this transport was inhibited by phlorrhizin and by the absence of Na(+). 4. 3-O-Methyl-d-glucose, d-arabinose and l-arabinose were not actively transported, [S](i)/[S](o) ratios never exceeding 1.0. 5. 2-Deoxy-d-glucose and 2-deoxy-d-galactose were readily accumulated against a high concentration gradient, this transport being Na(+)-independent and only slightly sensitive to phlorrhizin. External Na(+) was not required for an inhibitory action of phlorrhizin and d-galactose on the entry of 2-deoxy-d-galactose into the cells. 6. Interference for entry into the cells between the following saccharides was found: d-galactose inhibited alpha-methyl d-glucoside transport; d-xylose entry was inhibited by d-glucose; d-galactose transport was inhibited by d-xylose; a mutual interference between d-galactose and its 2-deoxy analogue was found. 7. It is concluded that d-glucose, d-galactose, alpha-methyl d-glucoside, d-xylose and possibly also some other monosaccharides share a common active transport system. 8. The specificity of the Na(+)-dependent phlorrhizin-sensitive active transport system for monosaccharides in kidney-cortex cells differs from that in intestinal epithelial cells.<Animals, Biological Transport, Active, drug effects, Carbon Isotopes, Cell Membrane Permeability, drug effects, Hexoses, antagonists &amp; inhibitors, In Vitro Techniques, Kidney Tubules, metabolism, Kinetics, Monosaccharides, metabolism, Ouabain, pharmacology, Phlorhizin, pharmacology, Rabbits, Sodium, pharmacology
16049928<Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and pyruvate carboxylase in developing rat liver.<1. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and pyruvate carboxylase were measured in foetal, newborn and adult rat liver extracts by a radiochemical assay involving the fixation of [(14)C]bicarbonate. 2. Pyruvate-carboxylase activity in both foetal and adult liver occurs mainly in mitochondrial and nuclear fractions, with about 10% of the activity in the cytoplasm. 3. Similar studies of the intracellular distribution of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase show that more than 90% of the activity is in the cytoplasm. However, in the 17-day foetal liver about 90% of the activity is in mitochondria and nuclei. 4. Pyruvate-carboxylase activity in both particulate and soluble fractions is very low in the 17-day foetal liver and increases to near adult levels before birth. 5. Phosphoenolpyruvate-carboxykinase activity in the soluble cell fraction increases 25-fold in the first 2 days after birth. This same enzyme in the mitochondria has considerable activity in the foetal and adult liver and is lower in the newborn. 6. Kinetic and other studies on the properties of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase have shown no differences between the soluble and mitochondrial enzymes. 7. It is suggested that the appearance of the soluble phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase at birth initiates the rapid increase in overall gluconeogenesis at this stage.<Aging, Animals, Animals, Newborn, Bicarbonates, metabolism, Carbon Isotopes, Carboxy-Lyases, analysis, Cell Nucleus, enzymology, Centrifugation, Chromatography, Cytoplasm, enzymology, Fetus, Gluconeogenesis, Kinetics, Ligases, analysis, Liver, enzymology, Male, Mitochondria, enzymology, Pyruvates, metabolism, Rats
16049929<Amino acid metabolism and protein synthesis in a pyrithiamine-requiring Staphylococcus aureus mutant.<1. Amino acid metabolism and protein synthesis in a Staphylococcus aureus mutant strain that requires pyrithiamine for optimum growth were studied and compared with those in the thiamine-requiring parent S. aureus. 2. The mutant strain utilized amino acids at a higher rate than did the parent strain. The utilization of glutamic acid, serine and glycine was much stimulated in the mutant strain. 3. The rate of oxidation of glutamic acid, aspartic acid, isoleucine and glycine was higher in the mutant strain. 4. The mutant strain contained serine, glycine, tyrosine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, arginine and histidine as free amino acids, whereas the parent strain possessed lysine, arginine, histidine, aspartic acid and glutamic acid. 5. The mutant strain possessed slightly higher glutamate-oxalo-acetate transaminase activity, whereas the activities of glutamate-pyruvate transaminase were similar in both strains. 6. The incorporation of (14)C from [2-(14)C]-acetate into individual amino acids of the cell protein was greater in the mutant strain. 7. The incorporation of (14)C-labelled amino acids into the cell proteins of the mutant strain was not much different from that in the parent strain. 8. Induction of beta-d-galactosidase in the mutant strain did not occur, whereas induction of this enzyme is possible in the parent strain. Thiamine or pyrithiamine has no direct effect on the induction of beta-d-galactosidase.<Acetates, metabolism, Amino Acids, metabolism, Carbon Isotopes, Enzyme Induction, Galactosidases, biosynthesis, Mutation, Protein Biosynthesis, Staphylococcus, metabolism, Thiamine, antagonists &amp; inhibitors, metabolism, Transaminases, metabolism
16049930<Lysozyme-catalysed hydrolysis of some beta-aryl di-N-acetylchitobiosides.<1. Four beta-aryl di-N-acetylchitobiosides and beta-S-phenyl di-N-acetylthiochitobioside have been prepared and shown to be substrates for hen's-egg-white lysozyme. 2. The lysozyme-catalysed hydrolysis of these substrates obeys Michaelis-Menten kinetics. 3. The Michaelis constants, K(m), for the beta-aryl di-N-acetyl-chitobiosides are almost independent of the aglycone, whereas the catalytic constants, k(cat.), show a marked dependence, giving a Hammett reaction constant, rho, equal to 1.2; this suggests the rate-determining step involves concerted acid-base or acid-nucleophilic catalysis. 4. This conclusion is supported by the Michaelis-Menten constants found for beta-S-phenyl di-N-acetylthiochitobioside. 5. A three-step reaction pathway is proposed, and mechanisms are suggested that would account for the evidence currently available.<Animals, Binding Sites, Catalysis, Chickens, Chitin, metabolism, Crustacea, Glycosides, metabolism, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Kinetics, Models, Chemical, Muramidase, metabolism, Ovalbumin, Polysaccharides, chemical synthesis, metabolism
16049931<The metabolism of phenethyl bromide, styrene and styrene oxide in the rabbit and rat.<1. The chief sulphur-containing metabolite of styrene and sytrene oxide in the rabbit and rat is chromatographically identical with N-acetyl-S-(beta-hydroxyphenethyl)-l-cysteine and this compound is also formed, together with N-acetyl-S-phenethyl-l-cysteine, as a metabolite of phenethyl bromide. 2. The amounts of the phenethylmercapturic acid and its hydroxy derivative excreted in the urine of animals dosed with phenethyl bromide, styrene, styrene oxide, phenyl glycol, S-phenylethylcysteine and phenethylmercapturic acid have been determined. 3. Liver slices convert phenethylcysteine and phenethylmercapturic acid into N-acetyl-S-(beta-hydroxyphenethyl)-l-cysteine. 4.

16049932<Analysis of phosphate esters in plant material. Extraction and purification.<1. A critical study was made of the quantitative extraction of nucleotide and sugar phosphates from plant tissue by either boiling aqueous ethanol or cold trichloroacetic acid. The effect of the extraction technique on the inactivation of the enzymes in the plant tissue and the possibility of adsorption of the phosphate esters on the cell wall were especially considered. 2. In the recommended method the plant tissue was frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground to a powder and then blended with cold aqueous trichloroacetic acid containing 8-hydroxyquinoline to prevent adsorption. 3. The extract contained large amounts of trichloroacetic acid, cations, chloride, sugars, amino acids, hydroxy organic acids, phytic acid, orthophosphoric acid and high-molecular-weight material including some phosphorus-containing compounds. All of these were removed as they were liable to interfere with the chromatographic or enzymic assay of the individual nucleotide or sugar phosphates. 4. The procedure was as follows: the last traces of trichloroacetic acid were extracted with ether after the solution had been passed through a column of Dowex AG 50 in the hydrogen form to remove all cations. High-molecular-weight compounds were removed by ultrafiltration and low-molecular-weight solutes by a two-stage chromatography on cellulose columns with organic solvents. In the first stage, sugars, amino acids, chloride and phytic acid were separated by using a basic solvent (propan-1-ol-water-aqueous ammonia) and, in the second stage, the organic acids and orthophosphoric acid were separated by using an acidic solvent (di-isopropyl ether-formic acid-2-methylpropan-2-ol-water). The final solution of nucleotide and sugar phosphates was substantially free from other solutes and was suitable for the detection of individual phosphate esters by either chromatography or enzymic assay. 5. The recovery of d-glucose 6-phosphate or adenosine 5'-triphosphate added to a trichloroacetic acid extract simulating that from peas and potatoes, and isolated according to the standard procedures, was better than 95%. Estimation of naturally occurring d-glucose 6-phosphate and adenosine 5'-triphosphate in the initial extract of peas and potatoes and in the final purified extract also indicated a recovery of about 95%. A similar estimation of uridine diphosphate glucose in potatoes showed that little or no breakdown occurred.<Animals, Biological Assay, Chromatography, Ethanol, Hexosephosphates, analysis, Methods, Nucleotides, analysis, Plants, Edible, analysis, Solubility, Trichloroacetic Acid
16049933<Chemical analysis of acetylated bovine growth hormone, a growth-hormone inhibitor.<Purified bovine growth hormone was acetylated with acetic anhydride under various conditions. Acetylated bovine growth hormone prepared in anhydrous acetic anhydride at 43 degrees for 5min. inhibited the growth-promoting response of unmodified bovine growth hormone in hypophysectomized rats. This acetylated bovine growth hormone contained 18 total acetyl groups/mol., which included 12 N(in)-acetyl and 6-8 hydroxylamine-reactive acetyl groups (acetylated aliphatic hydroxy amino acids and 2-3 O-acetyltyrosine residues). Deacetylation of acetylated bovine growth hormone with hydroxylamine at pH9.5 destroyed its ability to inhibit the growth-promoting activity of bovine growth hormone.<Acetates, Amino Acids, analysis, Anhydrides, Animals, Carbon Isotopes, Cattle, Chemical Phenomena, Chemistry, Growth Hormone, antagonists &amp; inhibitors, Hypophysectomy, Rats
16049934<The microbial oxidation of methanol. The prosthetic group of the alcohol dehydrogenase of Pseudomonas sp. M27: a new oxidoreductase prosthetic group.<1. The purified alcohol dehydrogenase of Pseudomonas sp. M27, whose action is independent of nicotinamide nucleotides, has absorption peaks at 280mmu and at 350mmu with little or no absorption at or above 450mmu. 2. It does not fluoresce, but green-fluorescent material, diffusible on dialysis, is produced when the enzyme is treated with acid or alkali or when it is boiled. 3. Evidence is presented that the enzyme is not a flavoprotein. 4. Kinetic studies show a correlation between enzyme inactivation by acid, alkali or heat and liberation of the fluorescent material. 5. Some purification of the fluorescent material was achieved, but definite identification was not possible; the major component has a fluorescence maximum at about 460mmu with excitation maxima at about 260mmu and 365mmu. 6. Data are given (including absorption and fluorescence spectra) that support the suggestion that the prosthetic group of the enzyme is a pteridine derivative. 7. Possible mechanisms of action of the enzyme are discussed.<Alcohol Oxidoreductases, analysis, metabolism, Biological Assay, Fluorescence, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Kinetics, Pseudomonas, enzymology, Pteridines, analysis, Spectrum Analysis
16049935<Acylation of aspartate aminotransferase.<1. Acetylation of aspartate aminotransferase from pig heart inhibits completely the enzymic activity when the coenzyme is in the amino form (pyridoxamine phosphate) or when the coenzyme has been removed, but not when the coenzyme is in the aldehyde form (pyridoxal phosphate). 2. The group the acylation of which is responsible for the inhibition has been identified with the in-amino group of a lysine residue at the coenzyme-binding site. Moreover, in the pyridoxamine-enzyme the amino group of the coenzyme is also acetylated. 3. The reactivity of the coenzyme-binding lysine residue is greatly different in the pyridoxamine-enzyme and in the apoenzyme, suggesting the possibility of an interaction of its in-amino group with pyridoxamine or with other groups on the protein.<Acetates, Animals, Aspartate Aminotransferases, antagonists &amp; inhibitors, Binding Sites, Chemical Phenomena, Chemistry, Chromatography, Coenzymes, antagonists &amp; inhibitors, Electrophoresis, Myocardium, enzymology, Pyridoxal Phosphate, pharmacology, Swine
16049936<Submicrodeterminations of thiols, disulphides and thiol esters in serum by using o-hydroxymercuribenzoic acid and dithiofluorescein.<1. Methods are described for selective estimation of thiols, disulphides and thiol esters in standard solutions and in serum. The methods are based on the reaction with the excess of o-hydroxymercuribenzoic acid (HMB) in alkaline solution with subsequent addition of dithiofluorescein in excess and determination of the extinction at 588mmu. The sensitivity of the methods amounts to 1.5x10(-9)g.equiv. in 5ml. of final solution. Of results obtained on standard solutions 80% have the errors within the range +/-4%. 2. It has been found that serum contains an unidentified substance (substance X) producing green complexes with dithiofluorescein which undergo decomposition on addition of formaldehyde. The correction for substance X must be estimated in a separate sample and taken into account. The concentration of substance X can be calculated from extinctions measured at 588mmu and 635mmu in the presence of dithiofluorescein in excess. 3. The selective determination of thiols and disulphides is based on different reaction rates with formaldehyde. The complexes between HMB and cysteine can be selectively decomposed by formaldehyde, and free glutathione can be selectively removed by formaldehyde in the presence of protein thiols. 4. Thiols are determined in the presence of triethylamine, thiols plus disulphides in the presence of triethylamine and sulphite, and thiols plus thiol esters in the presence of dimethylamine, with subsequent addition of ammonium sulphate.<Cysteine, blood, Cystine, blood, Fluoresceins, Formaldehyde, Glutathione, blood, Homocystine, blood, Mercury, Methods, Microchemistry, Sulfides, blood
16049937<The metabolism of n-decane by a Pseudomonas.<The growth of a Pseudomonas on n-decane was found to produce stearic acid, oleic acid, palmitic acid, palmitoleic acid, decanoic acid, octanoic acid, beta-hydroxydecanoic acid, beta-hydroxyoctanoic acid, beta-hydroxyhexanoic acid and beta-hydroxyadipic acid. Small amounts of n-decanamide and n-valeramide were also isolated.

16049938<Development of uridine diphosphate-glucuronyltransferase activity in cultures of chick-embryo liver.<1. The liver of the domestric fowl (Gallus gallus) remains capable of conjugating o-aminophenol with glucuronic acid after 8 days' culture. The pathway of o-aminophenyl glucuronide formation in cultured liver, as in fresh tissue, includes the enzyme UDP-glucuronyltransferase. 2. UDP-glucuronyltransferase activity in chick-embryo liver increases on culture from very low to adult values within 6-8 days. 3. The development of UDP-glucuronyltransferase activity in cultured chick-embryo liver requires certain serum factors in the medium. The requirements change with embryo age. Liver from embryos younger than 15 days develops enzyme activity equally well in media containing either foetal or adult serum; liver from embryos older than 16 days develops activity only with adult serum. The development of enzyme activity in liver from the older embryos appears to be stimulated by diffusible factors in adult serum and inhibited by diffusible factors in foetal serum. It is suggested that the stimulation and inhibition of enzyme formation by small, diffusible molecules may be part of the mechanism regulating UDP-glucuronyltransferase activity in vivo. 4. Liver from 19-day-old chick embryos cultured with foetal serum begins to develop UDP-glucuronyltransferase activity if transferred to an adult-serum medium. Its capacity to develop UDP-glucuronyltransferase activity in adult serum survives in a foetal-serum medium for at least 5 days, the longest period tested. 5. The activity of UDP-glucuronyltransferase reached in 19-day chick-embryo liver after 1 or 2 days with adult serum is maintained without further increase after transfer to a foetal-serum medium. After 3 days with adult serum UDP-glucuronyltransferase activity continues to increase when the tissue is transferred to a foetal-serum medium. Thus liver from 19-day-old embryos requires 3 days with adult serum before development of enzyme activity becomes independent of a continuous adult-serum environment.<Aging, Animals, Chick Embryo, enzymology, Culture Media, pharmacology, Culture Techniques, Enzyme Induction, Glucosyltransferases, biosynthesis, Liver, enzymology
16050052<The development of imitation by reinforcing behavioral similarity to a model.<This research demonstrated some of the conditions under which retarded children can be taught to imitate the actions of adults. Before the experiment, the subjects were without spontaneous imitative behavior, either vocal or motor. Each subject was taught, with food as reinforcement, a series of responses identical to responses demonstrated by an experimenter; i.e., each response was reinforced only if it was identical to a prior demonstration by an experimenter. Initially, intensive shaping was required to establish matching responses by the subjects. In the course of acquiring a variety of such responses, the subjects' probability of immediate imitation of each new demonstration, before direct training, greatly increased. Later in the study, certain new imitations, even though perfect, were never reinforced; yet as long as some imitative responses were reinforced, all remained at high strength. This imitativeness was then used to establish initial verbal repertoires in two subjects.<Child, Humans, Imitative Behavior, Intellectual Disability, Models, Psychological, Motor Skills, Reinforcement, Psychology, Verbal Behavior
16050053<Effects of reinforcement magnitude on choice and rate of responding.<Behavior is sometimes insensitive, and sometimes extremely sensitive, to changes in reinforcement magnitude. The present work attempted to analyze this disparity by comparing, in a single experimental situation, a pigeon's choices with its response rates. Whereas choices varied directly with reinforcement duration, rates of responding were comparatively insensitive to duration changes. These results suggest that the effect of reinforcement magnitude on responding partly depends upon the extent to which responding influences the amount of reinforcement.<Animals, Columbidae, Discrimination Learning, Male, Reaction Time, Reinforcement, Psychology, Time Factors
16050054<The reinforcement of short interresponse times.<Five contingencies were superimposed successively on a variable-interval schedule of reinforcement. In each of the resulting conditions, a different short, interresponse time was reinforced and an interresponse-time distribution was obtained from each of three pigeons. The lower bound of the reinforced interresponse times ranged from 0.3 to 2.4 sec. The resulting distributions were combined, according to a rationale based upon concurrent operants, induction, and a property of variable-interval schedules, to describe the interresponse-time distributions from a variable-interval schedule.<Animals, Columbidae, Conditioning, Operant, Male, Reaction Time, Reinforcement Schedule, Reinforcement, Psychology
16050057<Discriminated punishment: avoidable and unavoidable shock.<Warning stimuli for two punishment conditions were alternated with periods of appetitive responding by rats. In either warning stimulus, the first response produced a brief shock, terminated the stimulus, and started an interval during which the baseline appetitive schedule was in effect. Not responding resulted in stimuli of random duration, which terminated with a shock under one condition and without a shock under the other. Each subject was exposed to several shock intensities, with trials for the two conditions programmed during alternate portions of the session. In general, response frequency in the warning signal for either condition decreased with increasing intensity; however, at a given intensity, responding was more frequent in the stimulus invariably terminating with shock than in the stimulus terminating without shock when no response was made. The frequency difference was greatest at intensities intermediate between those producing minimal and maximal suppression.<Animals, Appetitive Behavior, Avoidance Learning, Discrimination Learning, Electroshock, Methods, Punishment, Rats
16050058<Is bar-holding with negative reinforcement preparatory or perseverative.<Three of four white rats learned to press first one bar and then another to escape or avoid electric shocks. Cumulative bar-holding-time records showed that holding occurred frequently on the second bar but hardly ever on the first, indicating that bar-holding is more "perserverative" than "preparatory". The response chain, first-bar press second-bar press, was more easily established by a forward than by a backward chaining procedure.<Animals, Avoidance Learning, Conditioning, Operant, Electroshock, Escape Reaction, Male, Rats
16050059<Methylphenidate and stimulus control of avoidance behavior.<The introduction of a warning signal that preceded a scheduled shock modified the temporal distribution of free-operant avoidance responses. With response-shock and shock-shock intervals held constant, response rates increased only slightly when the response-signal interval was reduced. The result is consistent with Sidman's (1955) findings under different conditions, but at variance with Ulrich, Holz, and Azrin's (1964) findings under similar conditions. Methylphenidate in graded doses increased response rates, modifying frequency distributions of interresponse times. Drug treatment may have disrupted a "temporal discrimination" formed within the signal-shock interval. More simply, methylphenidate influenced response rates by increasing short response latencies after signal onset; this effect was more prominent than the drug's tendency to increase the frequency of pre-signal responses. When signal-onset preceded shock by 2 sec, individual differences in performance were marked; methylphenidate suppressed responding in one rat as a function of increasing dose levels to a greater degree than in a second animal, but both subjects received more shocks than under control conditions.<Animals, Avoidance Learning, drug effects, Electroshock, Male, Methylphenidate, pharmacology, Rats, Reaction Time, drug effects

Individual ducklings then lived in the apparatus under an arrangement in which each peck produced a 15-sec stimulus presentation. For all ducklings, key-pecks tended to occur in bursts, and as the duckling matured, burst length decreased and the interval between bursts increased. However, even when subjects were 60 days old, some responses still occurred.<Animals, Animals, Newborn, Behavior, Animal, Ducks, Extinction, Psychological, Imprinting, Psychological
16050102<Membrane properties of the smooth muscle of guinea-pig ureter.<1. The membrane properties of the guinea-pig ureter were studied in physiological Krebs solution by intra- and extracellular stimulating methods.2. The mean membrane potential was 50 mV. Action potentials triggered by external stimulation were composed of repetitive spikes and a plateau phase.3. The effects of intracellular polarization on the membrane activity elicited by extracellular stimulation were observed. Anodal polarization enhanced the amplitude and the maximum rate of rise of the spike while cathodal polarization reduced them. The number of the spikes, the duration and amplitude of the plateau phase were not changed by polarization of any direction.4. The spikes triggered by intracellular stimulation were mostly graded, but repetitive spikes sometimes continued even after cessation of the stimulation. The effective membrane resistance was 15-23 MOmega and the time constant was 2-3 msec.5. Conduction velocity (V), chronaxie, time constant (tau) and space constant (lambda) of the tissue were measured by extracellular stimulation. These values were as follows: V, 3-6 cm/sec; chronaxie, 20-40 msec; tau, 200-300 msec; lambda, 2.5-3 mm. The conduction of excitation might be related to the cable properties of the tissue.6. The relative refractory period measured by extracellular stimulation was as long as 30 sec. During the relative refractory period dissociation of the slow depolarization and the spikes was observed by successive stimuli.7. The plateau phase was prolonged and the frequency of the spontaneous discharges was increased by treatment with Ba(2+). Tetrodotoxin had no effect on spike activity nor on the plateau phase, but Mn(2+) blocked the membrane activity.<Action Potentials, drug effects, physiology, Animals, Barium, pharmacology, Cats, Electric Stimulation, Electrophysiology, Guinea Pigs, In Vitro Techniques, Manganese, pharmacology, Membrane Potentials, drug effects, physiology, Muscle, Smooth, cytology, physiology, Oscillometry, Tetrodotoxin, pharmacology, Ureter, physiology
16050103<Electrophysiological study of the intestinal smooth muscle of the guinea-pig.<The membrane properties of single cells of intestinal smooth muscle of duodenum, jejunum, ileum, caecum and rectum of guinea-pig have been studied.1. The membrane potentials of longitudinal muscles of the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, caecum and rectum varied from 54 to 56 mV and those of circular muscles of jejunum, ileum, caecum and rectum varied from 57 to 60 mV. The ablated longitudinal muscle had a slightly lower value (50 mV) than the intact one.2. The longitudinal muscle generated spontaneous discharges but these were rare in the circular muscles of the intestine except for the caecum. Overshoot potentials could be observed in all regions of the intestine. The maximum rate of rise of the spontaneously discharging longitudinal muscles varied from 11 to 18 V/sec.3. Not all of the slow potential changes (but at least some) were generated by the nervous elements distributed between the muscle layers and in them.4. The conduction velocities measured from the longitudinal muscles of jejunum and rectum in the presence of tetrodotoxin were 2.1 cm/sec and 4.0 cm/sec respectively.5. Chronaxies of the longitudinal muscles of jejunum and rectum were 2-5 msec and 5-18 msec respectively.6. Intracellular stimulation of the single cells of the duodenum and caecum could trigger a spike, similar to that observed in the taenia coli. The spikes were mostly graded ones; a spike of full size was rarely elicited. When the spikes were triggered, the after-hyperpolarization appeared consistently presumably caused by the increased potassium conductance.7. The effective membrane resistance and the time constant were measured for the longitudinal muscles of the jejunum and rectum. When spikes were generated by intracellular stimulation the observed values were 40-50 MOmega and 3-5 msec in both tissues. These values were the same as those observed in the taenia coli.8. When the time constant of the membrane was measured by the extracellular polarizing method, the longitudinal muscles of the jejunum especially and the rectum had smaller time constants than the taenia coli.9. The differences of conduction velocity and chronaxie of the different regions of the intestine are discussed in relation to the cable properties of the tissues which are directly influenced by the morphological arrangements of the tissues.<Action Potentials, drug effects, physiology, Animals, Cats, Electric Stimulation, Electrophysiology, Guinea Pigs, Intestines, cytology, physiology, Membrane Potentials, drug effects, physiology, Muscle, Smooth, cytology, physiology, Oscillometry, Tetrodotoxin, pharmacology
16050104<Nervous factors influencing the membrane activity of intestinal smooth muscle.<The effects of various chemical agents on the spontaneous membrane activities and those electrically elicited in the smooth muscles of small intestine were investigated.1. The effects of various chemicals on the spontaneously active membrane might be summarized as follows. (a) Cholinergic agents; atropine slightly hyperpolarized the membrane and reduced the amplitude of slow potential changes even in aged preparations. Prostigmine depolarized the membrane, and enhanced the amplitude and prolonged the duration of the slow potential changes. Atropine prevented the actions of prostigmine on the membrane. (b) Ba(2+) depolarized the membrane, and enhanced the amplitude and prolonged the duration of the slow potential changes. The spike frequency was initially increased, then reduced. Atropine and tetrodotoxin partially prevented the action of Ba(2+) on the membrane activities.2. Effects of chemical agents on the membrane activity elicited by electrical stimulation might be summarized as follows. (a) Short pulse stimulation (0.5-1 msec) generated the spike as a direct response of the muscle cell membrane, then it was followed by slow depolarization, delayed hyperpolarization, i.e. the ;inhibitory potential', and post-inhibitory rebound successively. (b) The slow depolarization and the post-inhibitory rebound were reduced in amplitude by treatment with atropine, and enhanced by treatments with prostigmine and Ba(2+). Tetrodotoxin blocked all activities except the spike.3. When repetitive stimulation (20 c/s) was applied to the membrane, the membrane hyperpolarized; then, after 3-5 sec, it gradually depolarized even if the stimulation was continued, and triggered spikes. The hyperpolarization always preceded depolarization. The duration and the amplitude of the delayed depolarization was proportionally increased by the increased intensity and duration of stimulation. Atropine and tetrodotoxin blocked the generation of the post-inhibitory rebound.4. Effects of repetitive stimulation on the stored tissues were observed. The responses to repetitive stimulation of the membrane of muscles which had been stored 50 hr at 4 degrees C, were the same as those observed in the fresh tissue. The response of the tissue which had been stored 100 hr was the same as that observed in the fresh tissue treated with tetrodotoxin, i.e. all activities except the spikes were blocked.<Animals, Atropine, pharmacology, Barium, pharmacology, Depression, Chemical, Electrophysiology, Guinea Pigs, Intestine, Small, drug effects, Membrane Potentials, drug effects, Muscle, Smooth, drug effects, Oscillometry, Parasympathomimetics, pharmacology, Rabbits, Tetrodotoxin, pharmacology
16050105<Cardiac sympathetic adrenergic pathways in which synaptic transmission is blocked by atropine sulfate.<1. Stimulation of the thoracic sympathetic nerve trunk caused a rise in arterial blood pressure and heart rate which was reduced but not abolished during the infusion of hexamethonium chloride, pentolinium tartrate, mecamylamine or tetraethylammonium chloride.2. Preganglionic stimulation no longer elicited a synchronous sC elevation in the post-ganglionic nerves. The persistent blood pressure and heart rate response was associated with an asynchronous discharge in these nerves.3. Both the persistent response and the asynchronous discharge were abolished by the intravenous injection of atropine sulphate in doses of 30 mug/kg.4. Atropine had no effect on spike amplitude or shape, conduction velocity or frequency response in either the pre- or post-ganglionic nerve trunks. Nor did it affect the rise in blood pressure and heart rate evoked by stimulation of the post-ganglionic cardiac sympathetic nerves.5. It is concluded that atropine partially blocked synaptic transmission in cardiac sympathetic adrenergic pathways.<Animals, Atropine, pharmacology, Blood Pressure, drug effects, Cats, Dogs, Heart Rate, drug effects, Hexamethonium Compounds, pharmacology, Mecamylamine, pharmacology, Neural Conduction, drug effects, Pentolinium Tartrate, pharmacology, Sympathetic Nervous System, drug effects, Tetraethylammonium Compounds, pharmacology
16050106<Partition of sodium fluxes in isolated toad oocytes.<1. The rate constant for Na efflux from the oocyte calculated from (d/dt) (ln [Na(*)](i)]) is only approximately 52% of that calculated from (d/dt)[(ln(d[Na(*)](i))dt)]. The difference may be interpreted by supposing that 48% of the internal Na of the oocyte is either bound to proteins or sequestered in cell organelles.2. The mean rate constant for Na efflux was 6.4 x 10(-3) min(-1) corresponding to an apparent Na efflux rate of 13.3 p-mole/cm(2).sec. When this is corrected for the increase in surface area produced by microvilli the true efflux rate is 1.1-1.3 p-mole/cm(2).sec.3. The action of ouabain (1-5 muM) appears to involve two different effects: (a) there is 48-65% inhibition of the membrane Na pump, and (b) there is a release of some of the sequestered Na in the cell.4. Removal of external K causes a 40% reduction in Na efflux although this value may be an underestimation owing to the presence of K which has leaked from the cell and may be retained near the cell surface.5. Raising the external K concentration to 15 mM reduces the inhibitory effect of ouabain by approximately a half.6. It was concluded that the Na pump in the toad oocyte may have a slightly lower level of activity than that in frog muscle, but that its general properties are similar to those in frog muscle and some other animal cells.<Animals, Anura, Biological Transport, Female, Ouabain, pharmacology, Ovum, physiology, Potassium, metabolism, Sodium, metabolism
16050107<Effect of progressive hypoxia on the respiratory &amp; cardiovascular system of chickens.<1. During the initial stages of progressive hypoxia the intact, unanaesthetized chicken shows increases in heart rate and respiratory frequency with no change in arterial blood pressure and oxygen consumption. During the later stages, heart rate, diastolic and mean blood pressure and oxygen consumption fall, while respiratory frequency increases further.2. Following bilateral cervical vagotomy and adrenergic beta-receptor blockage there is no tachycardia, but the late bradycardia and fall in blood pressure do occur during progressive hypoxia. Respiratory frequency remains at a low level after vagotomy.3. It is suggested that the initial tachycardia is dependent on both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, and that the former helps maintain arterial pressure during the early stages of hypoxia. Bradycardia and hypotension seem to be due to anoxia itself, and the vagus is essential for the increase in respiratory frequency.<Animals, Blood Pressure, physiology, Chickens, Heart Rate, physiology, Hypoxia, physiopathology, Male, Respiration, physiology, Sympatholytics, pharmacology, Vagotomy
16050108<Observations on the site &amp; mode of action of pyrogens in the rabbit brain.<1. Leucocyte pyrogen has been injected bilaterally into various parts of the rabbit brain. It caused fever when injected into the pre-optic area and the anterior hypothalamus, but not when injected into the posterior hypothalamus, the mid-brain, the pons, the cerebellum or the cerebral cortex.2. The mean time which elapsed between a leucocyte pyrogen injection into the anterior hypothalamus and the onset of fever was 7.8 min. For similar injections of bacterial pyrogen the time lag was 24.8 min. The mean time lag between bilateral injections of noradrenaline into the anterior hypothalamus and the onset of fever was 7.4 min.3. The amount of leucocyte pyrogen required to cause fever when injected into the anterior hypothalamus was less than 1/100 of that required to cause a similar fever on intravenous injection. The quantity of bacterial pyrogen injected into the hypothalamus was of the same order as that which would cause a similar fever on intravenous injection.4. Control injections of saline, plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, heated leucocyte pyrogen and red cells into the anterior hypothalamus did not cause fever.5. After attempts to deplete the hypothalamus of its monoamine stores by intraventricular injections of reserpine, the rabbit had fever as a result of an intravenous injection of bacterial pyrogen.6. We conclude that the anterior hypothalamus and the pre-optic area are sites at which leucocyte pyrogen acts to cause fever in the rabbit. The mechanism of this febrile response is not clear, but it appears that part, at least, of the response could be mediated by a mechanism other than release of noradrenaline or failure to release 5-HT.<Animals, Body Temperature, drug effects, Brain, drug effects, Cerebellum, drug effects, Cerebral Cortex, drug effects, Hypothalamus, drug effects, Leukocytes, Pons, drug effects, Pyrogens, pharmacology, Rabbits
16050109<Centrally evoked sympathetic discharge: a functional study of medullary vasomotor areas.<1. The medulla oblongata was stimulated electrically in decerebrate cats following bilateral vagotomy. Changes in splanchnic nerve discharge evoked by stimulation of pressor and depressor areas in the medulla are correlated with changes in arterial pressure. An interaction of baroreceptor afferents with the efferent sympathetic system at the level of the medulla and/or spinal cord is demonstrated. Evidence is presented which suggests that it is possible to alter activity selectively in a given division (splanchnic) of the sympathetic outflow.2. Evoked responses were categorized as follows:(a) Sustained splanchnic activation; an immediate increase in total splanchnic activity occurred with only a small, gradual decline in activity during the stimulation period. Mild stimulation (150-200 muA) raised systolic pressure by 60-80 mm Hg and stronger stimulation (300-400 muA) increased pressure by 100-150 mm Hg. When comparable pressor responses were elicited from points on either side of the mid line, splanchnic excitation was greater with homolateral stimulation (left side).(b) Unsustained splanchnic activation; an immediate increase in activity occurred which declined sharply as systolic pressure rose by 60-100 mm Hg during stimulation. Such a decline was attributed to the influence of baroreceptor afferents. Thus, if previous carotid occlusion was maintained during stimulation, the decline in activity was minimized although the pressor response increased. It is suggested that the structures yielding unsustained responses differ from those yielding sustained responses in their functional relation with the baroreceptor afferents.(c) Reduced splanchnic discharge during direct medullary stimulation; a partial or complete inhibition of splanchnic activity was obtained, which was sometimes accompanied by a 20-40 mm Hg reduction in systolic pressure. However, the direction and magnitude of the systemic pressure change were not as consistently related to the splanchnic response as they were during activation. Even if splanchnic efferent activity were elevated by carotid occlusion, stimulation still reduced discharge.<Animals, Cats, Electrophysiology, Evoked Potentials, Medulla Oblongata, physiology, Pressoreceptors, physiology, Splanchnic Nerves, physiology, Vasomotor System, physiology
16050110<Search for pulmonary arterial chemoreceptors in the cat, with a comparison of the blood supply of the aortic bodies in the newborn &amp; adult animal.<1. Electrophysiological and histological techniques have been employed to search for pulmonary arterial chemoreceptors in kittens and cats.2. In cats, impulses were recorded from vagal fibres arising from chemoreceptors in the aortico-pulmonary region. The receptors were identified by their response to hypoxia, and their location was investigated by comparing the effects of injecting drugs at various sites in the pulmonary and systemic circulations. In only one of a large number of experiments did a chemoreceptor appear to receive pulmonary rather than systemic arterial blood.3. No chemoreceptor impulses were evoked when a segment of the pulmonary artery was perfused as described by Duke, Green, Heffron &amp; Stubbens (1963).4. The vasculature of the aortico-pulmonary bodies was displayed by micro-dissection following injection of coloured gelatin masses, and the bodies were examined histologically. In the new-born kitten, the pulmonary artery invariably furnished a branch to some aortic bodies but the vessel frequently anastomosed with systemic arteries. As post-natal development proceeded the vessel became occluded, and in most kittens more than a month old and in forty-one of forty-three cats the aortic bodies were supplied wholly by systemic arteries.5. It was concluded that a pulmonary arterial supply to aortic bodies in the adult animal is an uncommon variation owing to the abnormal persistence of a foetal condition.6. Results indicated that the nomenclature introduced by Howe (1956) is, with slight modification, a useful method of classifying the various groups of aortic bodies according to their position, blood supply and innervation.<Animals, Animals, Newborn, Cats, Chemoreceptor Cells, growth &amp; development, Electrophysiology, Paraganglia, Nonchromaffin, blood supply, growth &amp; development, Pulmonary Artery, innervation
16050111<Effect of heating &amp; cooling the hypothalamus on behavioral thermoregulation in the pig.<1. Pigs were trained to push a switch with their snouts in order to obtain a short burst of infra-red heat on the skin.2. When the preoptic region of the hypothalamus was cooled by means of an implanted thermode, the rate at which the heaters were turned on increased at environmental temperatures ranging from 0 to 25 degrees C. At 30 and 35 degrees C cooling sometimes had no effect.3. The preoptic region was warmed either by means of a thermode or using radio-frequency heating from implanted electrodes. Warming the preoptic region decreased the rate at which the infra-red heaters were turned on, but the effect was not as obvious as the increases observed during cooling.4. Pigs placed in a cold or neutral environment did not learn to push a switch in order to obtain radio frequency heating of the preoptic region.<Animals, Behavior, Animal, Body Temperature Regulation, Hot Temperature, Hypothalamus, physiology, Hypothermia, Induced, Swine, physiology
16050112<Determination of plasmakinin &amp; kininogen levels in man.<1. A method for the estimation of free plasma kinin and kininogen is described, which is suitable for samples of blood taken in hospital.2. The method permits the assay of very low levels of kinin and substantially eliminates errors due to the presence of amines and other interfering substances.3. In normal subjects the mean value of free kinin is 2.8 ng (bradykinin equivalent)/ml. plasma, and 6.1 mug kininogen/ml.4. In vasovagal fainting, carcinoid flush, and dumping syndrome, during the phase of peripheral vasodilatation, the free kinin exceeds 10 ng/ml., and is often in excess of 30 ng/ml.5. Sudden release of free kinin is accompanied by a fall in kininogen level.<Adult, Aged, Animals, Biological Assay, Bradykinin, blood, Carcinoid Tumor, blood, Dumping Syndrome, blood, Female, Humans, Kinins, blood, Male, Middle Aged, Rats, Uterus, drug effects
16050113<Cortical responses to paired stimuli applied peripherally &amp; at sites along the somato-sensory pathway.<1. Experiments have been performed on animals anaesthetized with various anaesthetics to determine the responsiveness of the cortex to the second of a pair of identical stimuli applied at three sites along the sensory pathway, i.e. to the periphery, the medial lemniscus and to thalamocortical fibres.2. It has been found that in deeply anaesthetized animals the mass response recorded from the cerebral cortex to the second of a pair of peripheral or lemniscal stimuli became reduced in size if the interval between the stimuli was 30-500 msec. If the interval was less than 30 msec for peripheral stimuli or between 10 and 30 msec for lemniscal stimuli responses were not obtained to the second stimulus. This was found to be a basic pattern which could be modified in animals less deeply anaesthetized. In these animals, periods of relatively increased responsiveness were seen after peripheral stimulation.3. The post-synaptic responses recorded from the ventrobasal thalamus showed the same behaviour to the second of a pair of peripheral stimuli as did the cortex both as regards size and latency of the responses.4. The post-synaptic responses recorded from the cuneate nucleus rarely showed any reduction in size unless the separation between the stimuli was 10 msec or less; even at intervals as low as 3 msec there was no increase in the latency of the response.5. When a pair of stimuli were applied to thalamocortical fibres, a different pattern of cortical responsiveness was found. At the time the cortical response to stimulation at pre-thalamic sites was reduced or abolished, the response to stimulation at post-thalamic sites was unaltered or increased in size.6. Finally an attempt was made to correlate the mass response recorded from the cortical surface and the activity of single cortical cells. Two types of cell could be distinguished in the rat. Those lying from 0.35 to 1.2 mm deep in the cortex showed a response pattern, to paired stimuli, closely resembling that of the cortical mass response. Others situated deeper in the cortex were found which had a very long absolute unresponsive time, from 50 to 80 msec and a very long relative unresponsive time of 1 sec.<Animals, Cerebral Cortex, physiology, Electrophysiology, Medulla Oblongata, physiology, Neural Conduction, Peripheral Nerves, physiology, Rats, Rodentia, Thalamus, physiology
16050147<Some factors involved in the thalamic control of spontaneous barbiturate spindles.<1. The origin of thalamic and cortical spontaneous spindles was studied in cats anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbital.2. Complete removal of all cortical grey matter left the thalamic rhythmic spindle activity unchanged.3. Removal of the entire thalamus or pronounced oedema in the thalamus abolished completely the spindle activity in the corresponding hemisphere.4. In a neuronally isolated cortical area, a fast, low voltage background activity appeared, interrupted by occasional irregular rapid potential changes (sharp waves) of high voltage. Regular spindle rhythms were seldom observed unless excited by a depolarizing drug. Spontaneous spindles did not invade the isolated cortex via a bridge of intact cortical tissue.5. With increasingly larger destruction of the thalamus in a rostro-caudal direction, the activity in the post-cruciate cortex did not change until the anterior third of the thalamus was encroached upon. A transverse section in front of the thalamus nearly eliminated the cortical spindles.6. Complete removal of the mid line and intralaminar nuclei left the spontaneous rhythmic activity of the lateral thalamic nuclei and of the frontal cortex principally unchanged.7. Removal of the laterally located thalamic nuclei, including the n. ventralis posterolateralis (VPL), abolished virtually all spontaneous spindle activity of the frontal cortex, including the post-cruciate area.8. Local cortical cooling reduced the amplitude but not the frequency of the cortical spindles.9. Cooling of the whole brain reduced both the amplitude and the frequency of the spindles. At low temperatures, all spindle activity in the cortex disappeared, and occasional sharp waves occurred, as with de-afferentation.10. It is concluded that the rhythm of the cortical spontaneous barbiturate spindles is generated exclusively by thalamic neurones. The electromotive force of the corticographic waves, however, has a cortical origin.<Animals, Brachial Plexus, physiology, Cats, Cerebral Cortex, drug effects, physiology, Geniculate Bodies, physiology, Neural Conduction, physiology, Pentobarbital, Temperature, Thalamus, drug effects, physiology
16050150<Dependence of the magnitude of the Stiles-Crawford effect on retinal location.<1. The directional sensitivity (Stiles-Crawford effect) of retinal cones is supposed to be associated with their shape, but only extrafoveal cones have a cone-like shape; cones in the central fovea are elongated and look like rods.2. To determine whether the directional sensitivity of cones depends on their shape, the Stiles-Crawford effect was measured both in the central fovea and in the parafovea of the human eye.2. To ensure that the cone population tested was homogeneous, a small brief test flash, brought into the eye through the centre of the pupil, was placed at threshold by varying the intensity of a large adapting field. The directional sensitivity of the cones was determined by finding the efficiency of light to act as an adapting background as a function of position of entry in the pupil.4. Central foveal cones have a less pronounced directional sensitivity than parafoveal cones and this lends support to the conclusion that the Stiles-Crawford effect is connected with the shape of the retinal receptors.<Humans, Photoreceptor Cells, physiology, Pupil, physiology, Retina, physiology, Vision, Ocular, physiology
16050151<Cortical acetylcholine release and electroencephalographic arousal.<1. In cats anaesthetized with N(2)O-halothane acetylcholine (ACh) release from the parietal cortex was measured. In addition, low and high-frequency electroencephalographic (e.e.g.) activity was recorded quantitatively.2. Stimulation of the mesencephalic reticular formation at 30, 60 and 100/sec produced an identical increase in cortical ACh output, while 300/sec stimulation was about (1/3) as effective and 10/sec stimulation failed to increase ACh output.3. Reticular formation stimulation at 60 and 100/sec reduced the low-frequency and increased the high-frequency e.e.g. activity. Stimulation at 30 and 300/sec was less effective, while 10/sec stimulation had no effect on e.e.g.4. Acute undercutting of the cortex did not affect the resting output of ACh but greatly reduced the increase due to reticular formation stimulation as compared to the contralateral intact side. Cutting the cortex around the collection area did not affect the increase in ACh output due to reticular formation stimulation.5. Stimulation of the hypothalamus, medial thalamus and septum at 100/sec also increased cortical ACh output while stimulation of the dorsal hippocampus and caudate nucleus failed to do so.6. Low frequency cortical e.e.g. activity was reduced by stimulating the reticular formation, the hypothalamus, the medial thalamus and slightly by septum stimulation. High-frequency e.e.g. activity was increased by stimulating the reticular formation and the hypothalamus.7. It is concluded that the ACh measured originates from the neural tissue underlying the collection area. The increased release is concomitant to e.e.g. activation but the pathways involved in cortical e.e.g. activation and increased ACh release are distinct, since the two phenomena do not vary in a parallel fashion when the reticular formation is stimulated at different frequencies or when different subcortical areas are stimulated.8. The effectiveness of septal stimulation in increasing ACh release indicates that at least part of the cortical cholinergic fibres traverse this area on their way to the cortex.<Acetylcholine, metabolism, Animals, Cats, Cerebral Cortex, physiology, Electric Stimulation, Electroencephalography, Hypothalamus, physiology, Mesencephalon, physiology, Neural Conduction, physiology, Reticular Formation, physiology, Thalamus, physiology
16050153<The effect of chromatic aberration on visual acuity.<1. Differences of threshold contrast are predicted from optical theory for a grating acuity target in monochromatic and white light. The greatest differences, up to 65%, are predicted for gratings of lower contrast and pitch than those normally used in measurements of visual acuity.2. Using three subjects, we measured contrast thresholds with 1.5 and 2.5 mm diameter artificial pupils for natural and paralysed accommodation, using a tungsten lamp and wave-lengths of 546 and 578 mm.3. Excellent agreement is obtained between predicted and measured differences.4. Results confirm that observed acuity and sensitivity differences between white and monochromatic lights are largely optical in origin, but involve at least two independent colour mechanisms as spectral weighting functions. Stiles's pi(4) and pi(5) sensitivities afford a much better fit to observed differences than the C.I.E. visibility curve.<Accommodation, Ocular, physiology, Color Perception, Humans, Optics and Photonics, Pupil, physiology, Retina, physiology, Vision, Ocular, physiology
16050157<The generation and spread of S-potentials in fish (Cyprinidae).<1. S-potentials from Luminosity-units in the excised eye of the tench (Tinca) were excited by white lights of various intensities and spatial distributions.2. When a small light spot of fixed size and intensity was presented at various distances from the recording electrode, the S-potential was found to suffer an exponential attenuation with distance (Fig. 3).3. A circular patch of light centred upon the electrode and varied in radius gave concordant results.4. The effects at the electrode site of a distant light flash was not due to light scattered to the electrode which acted upon the retina there; the light acted locally and it was the current that spread.5. With red and blue light stimuli superposed on the retina, it is the potentials not the lights that add.6. These experimental results seem to indicate that S-potentials can spread laterally across the retina within a thin layer at about the horizontal cell level.7. The layer is bounded by leaky membranes which appear to be electrogenic, no doubt as a result of transmitters released by light which change the permeability. Electric currents have no demonstrable effect.8. Two simple results were found. (a) The membrane contains an element whose conductance is proportional to the light intensity. (b) The S-potential is a hyperbolic function of light intensity.9. All these experimental results can be explained quantitatively in terms of the formal model of Fig. 8F. But the required change of membrane permeability with light has not yet been demonstrated.<Animals, Electrophysiology, Fishes, In Vitro Techniques, Models, Biological, Optics and Photonics, Retina, physiology, Retinal Pigments, physiology, Vision, Ocular, physiology
16050158<The innervation of the vas deferens of the guinea-pig.<1. The compound action potential of the hypogastric nerve of the guinea-pig contained two main elevations. The low-threshold fibres had a range of conduction velocities from 1.5 to 10 m/sec. The high threshold fibres conducted action potentials at less than 1 m/sec. The hypogastric nerve contained small myelinated fibres and non-myelinated fibres.2. In the preparation in vitro, junctional potentials and contractions were elicited by stimulation of the rapidly conducting fibres alone. Trains of C fibre volleys were ineffective.3. In the preparation in vivo, conduction from the hypogastric nerve to the vas deferens nerve was unidirectional and abolished by hexamethonium. After the administration of hexamethonium, the contraction produced by stimulation of the vas deferens nerve was unaffected.4. The close arterial injection of acetylcholine (ACh) into the pelvic viscera caused centrifugal activity in the motor fibres of the vas deferens nerve, but no impulses were detected in the hypogastric nerve.5. Ganglion cells are present in the last 2 cm of the hypogastric nerve.6. It is concluded that there is a ganglionic relay between the hypogastric and vas deferens nerves.<Acetylcholine, pharmacology, Action Potentials, Animals, Electric Stimulation, Guinea Pigs, Hexamethonium Compounds, pharmacology, Hypogastric Plexus, physiology, In Vitro Techniques, Male, Muscle Contraction, physiology, Muscle, Smooth, physiology, Neural Conduction, drug effects, physiology, Neuromuscular Junction, physiology, Neurons, physiology, Vas Deferens, anatomy &amp; histology, innervation
16050160<The dependence of slow inward current in Purkinje fibres on the extracellular calcium-concentration.<1. In sodium-free solution electrical constants of short Purkinje fibres were similar to those in Tyrode solution. Alterations in the extracellular calcium concentration ([Ca](o) = 0; 1.8; 7.2 mM) had no appreciable effect on these constants, unless the fibres were soaked in calcium-free solution for more than 40 min.2. In sodium-free solution without calcium there was constant or increasing outward current in response to sudden depolarizations (voltage-clamp technique) over the whole voltage range -85 to +40 mV. In calcium-containing solution initial outward current was followed by a slow change in current towards zero which was sometimes large enough to produce a net inward current. This current had a threshold in the voltage range -60 to -40 mV. It was not affected by alterations in the extracellular chloride or magnesium concentrations. The dependence on [Ca](o) suggests that the slow inward current is carried by calcium ions.3. Negative slopes in the steady-state current-voltage relations were obtained in fibres soaked in calcium-containing solutions but were never observed in calcium-free solution.4. The calcium equilibrium potential (E(Ca)) was estimated to be about 150 mV, inside positive.5. In Tyrode solution the slow inward current was smaller than in sodium-free solution and its threshold was shifted to about -20 to -10 mV. It was dependent on [Ca](o) as in sodium-free solution. It was increased by adrenaline and not affected by tetrodotoxin.6. It is concluded that calcium ions carry an appreciable membrane current in the inward direction when the membrane of the Purkinje fibre is depolarized. This calcium current may be involved in excitation-contraction coupling.<Animals, Biological Transport, Calcium, pharmacology, Cattle, Cell Membrane Permeability, Heart Conduction System, drug effects, In Vitro Techniques, Membrane Potentials, Sheep, Sodium, pharmacology
16050162<Peripheral modification of sensory nerve responses after cross-regeneration.<1. Chemical responses of skin and tongue, recorded in vivo from intact and self-regenerated cutaneous or lingual nerves, were compared to responses from cutaneous nerves cross-united with distal stumps of lingual nerves. Cross-innervated tongue grafts were also studied.2. In contrast to normal tongue-nerve preparations, skin preparations usually showed responses to chemical stimulation with longer latency, higher threshold, and less variation of temporal pattern with diverse stimuli. These characteristics were similar when the nerve, having been cut, had regenerated.3. On chemical stimulation of the tongue, cutaneous nerves cross-innervating the tongue often yielded records which were ;gustatory' by all criteria. Some responses with low threshold and short latency were also obtained from dorsal cutaneous nerves innervating tongue grafts.4. Thus, cutaneous nerves can serve the same role as gustatory nerves. The functional characteristics of these sensory neurones are not predetermined and must depend on the environment of the nerve endings.<Acetates, pharmacology, Action Potentials, Animals, Anura, Calcium Chloride, pharmacology, Chemoreceptor Cells, physiology, Electrophysiology, Facial Nerve, physiology, Mandibular Nerve, physiology, Mouth Mucosa, innervation, Nerve Regeneration, physiology, Peripheral Nerves, drug effects, physiology, Quinine, pharmacology, Skin, innervation, Sucrose, pharmacology, Tongue, innervation, Water, pharmacology
16050164<The relation between secretion of urate and p-aminohippurate in the rabbit kidney.<1. The renal excretion of urate in the rabbit was examined during infusion of other anions which are secreted by the kidney. A reduction of urate excretion occurred after administration of p-aminohippurate (PAH) and Diodrast which was proportional to the secretory rate of these compounds. On the other hand, urate was a less efficient inhibitor of PAH secretion.2. Stop-flow experiments showed that tubular secretion of urate at maximal values for secretion of PAH and Diodrast was almost completely suppressed.3. 2,4-Dinitrophenol, fumarate, succinate, salicylate, and probenecid depressed the excretion of urate and PAH, but the tubular secretion of urate was apparently more depressed than that of PAH by these inhibitors.4. It is concluded that a common transport system for urate and PAH is involved in the tubular secretion of urate and PAH in the rabbit. However, the affinity of urate for the transport system appears to be smaller than that of PAH.<Acids, pharmacology, Aminohippuric Acids, metabolism, pharmacology, Animals, Biological Transport, Dinitrophenols, pharmacology, Inulin, urine, Iodopyracet, pharmacology, Kidney, physiology, Male, Metabolic Clearance Rate, Rabbits, Uric Acid, antagonists &amp; inhibitors, blood, metabolism
16050165<The renal accumulation of urate and p-aminohippurate in the rabbit.<1. During intravenous infusion of urate and p-aminohippurate (PAH), the concentration of these two substances in cortex tissue of rabbit kidney exceeded the corresponding plasma concentration.2. Following the administration of 2,4-dinitrophenol, fumarate, succinate, probenecid, and salicylate, accumulation of urate in kidney cortex and renal net secretion of urate were abolished. The accumulation and secretion of PAH were only partially inhibited after infusion of these compounds.3. The renal accumulation of urate was reduced in relation to the inhibition of urate excretion during infusion of various amounts of PAH.4. The combined data indicate a correlation between renal accumulation and excretion of urate and PAH. It appears likely that accumulation of urate and PAH in vivo is due to tubular secretion of these two substances, although in the case of urate a small contribution from tubular reabsorption of urate cannot be excluded.<Acids, pharmacology, Aminohippuric Acids, metabolism, pharmacology, urine, Animals, Dinitrophenols, pharmacology, Inulin, urine, Kidney, drug effects, physiology, Male, Probenecid, pharmacology, Rabbits, Salicylates, pharmacology, Uric Acid, metabolism, pharmacology, urine
16050166<The content and localization of catecholamines in the carotid labyrinths and aortic arches of Rana temporaria.<1. The catecholamine content of the carotid labyrinth of Rana temporaria was estimated by two different methods, and compared with that of the aortic arch. In both tissues adrenaline was found as the dominant amine, with traces of dopamine and noradrenaline detectable in the labyrinth only.2. Per gram of fresh tissue, the labyrinth usually contained more adrenaline than the aortic arch.3. On microscopic examination, the aortic arch was found to contain nerve fibres which fluoresced after treatment with formaldehyde, whereas within the carotid labyrinth the formaldehyde-induced fluorescence was localized in the cytoplasm of clusters of small cells. This fluorescence resembled that exhibited by glomus cells in the mammalian carotid body.<Animals, Anura, Aorta, analysis, Brain Chemistry, Carotid Body, analysis, Catecholamines, analysis, Dopamine, analysis, Epinephrine, analysis, In Vitro Techniques, Microscopy, Fluorescence
16050168<Local and reflex factors affecting the distribution of the peripheral blood flow during arterial hypoxia in the rabbit.<1. The effects of severe arterial hypoxia on the blood flow in the portal vein, and in kidney, muscle and skin beds have been determined in normal unanaesthetized rabbits, in animals without functioning autonomic effectors, and in rabbits with section of the carotid sinus and aortic nerves.2. The resting blood flows in the above regions were not significantly different in the three groups.3. The susceptibilities of the various beds to the local dilator effects of arterial hypoxia (assessed from the responses of animals without functioning autonomic effectors) were markedly different; vasodilatation was by far the greatest in the portal bed, followed in order by the renal, skin and muscle beds.4. Section of the carotid sinus and aortic nerves completely abolished reflex activity, and the pattern of peripheral blood flow changes was similar to that of animals without functioning autonomic effectors. The findings suggest that the arterial chemoreceptors are the primary afferent source of reflex control of the peripheral circulation in arterial hypoxia.5. In normal animals with intact reflexes there was sustained vasoconstriction throughout the treatment period in the portal and renal bed. The net vasomotor effects in muscle and limb skin were small owing to the operation of a number of factors, which opposed the effects of reflexly increased sympathetic nerve activity.<Animals, Aorta, innervation, Autonomic Nervous System, physiology, Blood Gas Analysis, Carotid Sinus, physiology, Chemoreceptor Cells, physiology, Heart Rate, Hypoxia, Kidney, blood supply, Muscles, blood supply, Oxygen, pharmacology, Portal Vein, physiology, Rabbits, Regional Blood Flow, Respiration, Skin, blood supply, Vasomotor System, physiology
16050169<Distribution of peripheral blood flow in primary tissue hypoxia induced by inhalation of carbon monoxide.<1. The effects of primary tissue hypoxia induced by the inhalation of small concentrations of carbon monoxide in air on the distribution of blood flow in the portal, renal, muscle and skin beds have been studied in normal unanaesthetized rabbits, in animals without functioning autonomic effectors (;de-efferented' rabbits) and in animals with section of the carotid sinus and aortic nerves (;de-afferented' rabbits).2. The pattern of blood flow distribution during CO hypoxia was similar in ;de-efferented' and ;de-afferented' animals, suggesting that the effects in the latter were determined by local mechanisms. The susceptibility of the various beds to the local dilator effects of CO hypoxia was markedly different, the greatest dilator effects being observed in the portal bed, followed by skin, kidney, and muscle. The pattern is somewhat different from that observed in arterial hypoxia.3. In this type of hypoxia the arterial baroreceptors are probably the main afferent source of reflex activity. In normal animals reflex constrictor effects affect the portal and renal beds most, ;moderating' the local dilator effects of hypoxia in these beds. In muscle there is vasodilatation, probably the result of adrenaline secretion, but the response in skin is largely determined by the local effects of hypoxia. The total orthosympathetic activity evoked in this type of hypoxia appears to be less than in severe arterial hypoxia.<Animals, Autonomic Nervous System, drug effects, Blood Pressure, Carbon Monoxide, pharmacology, Chemoreceptor Cells, physiology, Ear, blood supply, Hypoxia, Kidney, blood supply, Muscles, blood supply, Portal Vein, drug effects, Rabbits, Regional Blood Flow, drug effects, Skin, blood supply, Vascular Resistance
16050170<Effects of haemorrhage on the distribution of the peripheral blood flow in the rabbit.<1. The effects of bleeding unanaesthetized rabbits by 26% of their blood volume on the blood flow in the portal, renal, muscle and skin beds were investigated in normal animals, in animals without functioning autonomic effectors, and in animals with section of the carotid sinus and aortic nerves.2. In animals without functioning autonomic effectors there was progressive vasodilatation during the 4 hr following haemorrhage, which differed markedly in the different regional beds studied. The dilatation was greatest in the portal bed, followed by kidney and skin, but there was no significant change in the vascular resistance in muscle.3. In normal animals with intact reflexes the vascular resistance either increases or remains at control values, suggesting that reflex constrictor effects oppose locally acting dilator mechanisms. During the 4 hr following haemorrhage reflex vasoconstrictor effects were greatest in kidney, followed by muscle, portal bed and skin.4. In animals with section of the carotid sinus and aortic nerves reflex constrictor effects were absent in the portal, muscle and skin beds, but significant vasoconstriction was still evident in the renal bed, though of smaller magnitude than in normal animals. The results suggest that the arterial baroreceptors are a major source of reflex activity following haemorrhage, but that other reflexogenic zones contribute to the renal effects in normal animals.<Animals, Autonomic Nervous System, physiology, Blood Volume, Carotid Body, physiology, Carotid Sinus, physiology, Heart Rate, physiology, Hematocrit, Hemorrhage, Kidney, blood supply, Muscles, blood supply, Portal Vein, physiology, Rabbits, Regional Blood Flow, Skin, blood supply
16050593<Reactivities of actin as a contractile protein.<The molecular basis for the mechanism of contraction in striated muscle, with primary emphasis on the interaction between the thick and thin filaments and the role of the thin (actin) filaments, is the theme presented. Recent information relating to actin-myosin interaction points up the fact that definitive statements cannot be made regarding the molecular interaction(s) that lead to contraction. Nevertheless, the properties of actin indicate that (a) actin in the monomeric state has properties differing markedly from actin in the polymer (filament) state; (b) these property differences may be significant in the contractile process, for they include changes in the reactivity of the bound nucleotide and actin-myosin complex formation; (c) the bound nucleotide seems to be required in the contraction process. For these, and other, reasons discussed, the tentative hypothesis is advanced that the contraction reaction involves local changes in the actin filament providing local monomer or monomer-like actin units in the reaction with myosin.<Adenosine Triphosphate, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Models, Biological, Muscle Contraction, physiology, Muscle Proteins, metabolism, Phosphates, pharmacology, Polymers, Temperature, Viscosity
16050594<The regulation of catch in molluscan muscle.<Molluscan catch muscles are smooth muscles. As with mammalian smooth muscles, there is no transverse ordering of filaments or dense bodies. In contrast to mammalian smooth muscles, two size ranges of filaments are present. The thick filaments are long as well as large in diameter and contain paramyosin. The thin filaments contain actin and appear to run into and join the dense bodies. Vesicles are present which may be part of a sarcoplasmic reticulum. Neural activation of contraction in Mytilus muscle is similar to that observed in mammalian smooth muscles, and in some respects to frog striated muscle. The relaxing nerves, which reduce catch, are unique to catch muscles. 5-Hydroxytryptamine, which appears to mediate relaxation, specifically blocks catch tension but increases the ability of the muscle to fire spikes. It is speculated that Mytilus muscle actomyosin is activated by a Ca(++)-releasing mechanism, and that 5-hydroxytryptamine may reduce catch and increase excitability by influencing the rate of removal of intracellular free Ca(++).<Animals, Calcium, metabolism, Cytoplasmic Granules, Electrophysiology, instrumentation, Endoplasmic Reticulum, Membrane Potentials, Microscopy, Electron, Mollusca, anatomy &amp; histology, Muscle Contraction, physiology, Muscle Proteins, Muscle, Smooth, physiology, Serotonin, metabolism
16050595<Variations of the contractile apparatus in smooth and striated muscles. X-ray diffraction studies at rest and in contraction.<Structural information is presented for three muscle systems-mammalian smooth muscle at rest and partially active, living toad striated muscle at rest and contracting, and glycerinated rabbit psoas muscle under various conditions of pH and ionic environment. In the smooth muscle no evidence of organized myosin filaments has been found. In the striated muscle the myosin-to-actin distance can vary widely, according to sarcomere length and to muscle treatment, both at rest and during contraction. In the discussion it is suggested that muscle should be considered as a colloidal system and that there need not necessarily be any chemical bonding (cross-linking) involved in the contractile process.<Action Potentials, Animals, Anura, Electrophysiology, instrumentation, Guinea Pigs, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Membrane Potentials, Muscle Contraction, physiology, Muscle Proteins, metabolism, Muscle, Smooth, Muscles, Rabbits, Rest, X-Ray Diffraction
16050597<Morphological aspects of ciliary motility.<In Elliptio complanatus lateral cilia, two distinct patterns of filament termination can be discerned. In one case, all nine filaments are present and all are single; in the second, at least one filament is missing but doublets are still present. These probably represent different configurations within one cilium in different stroke positions; to get from one to the other, some peripheral filaments must move with respect to others. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that the filaments themselves do not change length, but rather slide past one another to accommodate increasing curvature. The bent regions of the cilium are in the form of circular arcs. In a few cases, apparent displacement of filaments at the tip (Deltal) can be shown to be accounted for if we assume that all differences are generated within these arcs. The displacement per degree of bend is 35 A. Regions of bent arc are initially confined to the base of the cilium but move up the shaft as straight regions appear below them. From the relationship between arc length and radius of curvature, a shaft length that is the unit that initially bends and slides may be defined. Quantal displacements of the length of one 14S dynein may perhaps occur at sites between filaments at opposite sides of such a unit as sliding occurs.<Animals, Cilia, physiology, Microscopy, Electron, Mollusca, cytology
16050598<Some fundamental molecular mechanisms of contractility in fibrous macromolecules.<The fundamental molecular mechanisms of contractility and tension development in fibrous macromolecules are developed from the point of view of the principles of polymer physical chemistry. The problem is treated in a general manner to encompass the behavior of all macromolecular systems irrespective of their detailed chemical structure and particular function, if any. Primary attention is given to the contractile process which accompanies the crystal-liquid transition in axially oriented macromolecular systems. The theoretical nature of the process is discussed, and many experimental examples are given from the literature which demonstrate the expected behavior. Experimental attention is focused on the contraction of fibrous proteins, and the same underlying molecular mechanism is shown to be operative for a variety of different systems.<Adenosine Triphosphate, Animals, Chemical Phenomena, Chemistry, Physical, Macromolecular Substances, Mathematics, Models, Structural, Models, Theoretical, Muscle Contraction, Polymers, Proteins, Temperature
16050599<Contractility and conformation.<Contractility in fibers can arise from changes of macromolecular conformation caused by changes in some thermodynamic variable such as temperature, pH, or solvent composition. Illustrations are given of contractile processes in fibers and of changes in macromolecular conformation in dilute solution. These may involve order-disorder transitions, e.g. of the type exhibited by the helix-coil transition. A statistical mechanical treatment of the helix-coil transition involves the assignment of statistical weights to various states and the proper counting of these statistical weights in the formation and evaluation of the partition function; the thermodynamic properties of the system are derivable from the partition function. The counting procedure involved in the consideration of the alpha-helix and random coil is described. In addition, the factors affecting the relative stabilities of various helical conformations are discussed. These considerations of macromolecular conformation provide a basis for discussing contractile mechanisms in which changes of conformation are involved.<Animals, Chemical Phenomena, Chemistry, Collagen, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Macromolecular Substances, Models, Structural, Muscle Contraction, Polymers, Rats, Temperature, Thermodynamics
16050606<Influence of the ionic environment on the membrane potential of adrenal chromaffin cells and on the depolarizing effect of acetylcholine.<1. Intracellular recordings were made from chromaffin cells isolated from adrenal medullae of gerbils to examine the effects, on membrane potential, of changes in the ionic environment that are known, from other experiments, to influence the rate of catecholamine secretion.2. Depolarization in response to acetylcholine fell linearly with the logarithm of the extracellular sodium concentration over the range 154-3 mM and reached a value, in sodium-free medium, of about 30% of the control value.3. The depolarizing effect of acetylcholine in sodium-free media increased linearly with the logarithm of the extracellular calcium concentration over the range 1-117 mM. It is concluded that depolarization in response to acetylcholine involves inward movement of both sodium and calcium ions.4. Depolarization was also observed in response to the secretagogues, excess potassium and barium, both in sodium-rich and sodium-free media. The effect of barium was antagonized by calcium, and it is suggested that these two cations interact at the level of the plasma membrane.5. Depolarization does not appear to be tightly coupled to secretion, for acetylcholine or excess potassium still depolarized the chromaffin cells when the environment was calcium-free or contained an excess of magnesium, conditions that inhibit secretion. Furthermore, although acetylcholine had some depolarizing effect in sodium-free media, the level to which the membrane potential fell was not below the control ;resting' potential since the cells in sodium-free medium were hyperpolarized; yet, secretory responses are augmented in such conditions.6. It is proposed that depolarization in response to acetylcholine may be no more than the electrical sign of increased permeability to ions such as sodium and calcium, and that depolarization is not, in itself, a key event in stimulus-secretion coupling. The evidence is held to favour the view that movement of calcium into the chromaffin cells on exposure to acetylcholine is responsible for evoking secretion.<Acetylcholine, pharmacology, Adrenal Medulla, drug effects, metabolism, Animals, Barium, pharmacology, Biological Transport, Calcium, pharmacology, Chromaffin System, drug effects, Electrophysiology, Gerbillinae, In Vitro Techniques, Magnesium, pharmacology, Membrane Potentials, drug effects, Potassium, pharmacology, Sodium, pharmacology
16050608<The effect of water diuresis on electrolyte excretion in unanaesthetized dogs.<1. The relation between water loading and electrolyte excretion in dogs fed on a meat diet proved impossible to evaluate owing to the large variability in electrolyte excretion rates in control experiments.2. In animals fed a synthetic diet of constant and known composition the administration of a water load of 2.5% of body weight caused significant increases in the rate of excretion of sodium (P &lt; 0.01) and potassium (P &lt; 0.05). The chloride excretion rate also increased in the one animal tested.3. The significance of these results is discussed.<Animals, Diet, Diuresis, physiology, Dogs, Female, Natriuresis, Potassium, urine, Water Intoxication, urine, Water-Electrolyte Balance
16050610<The relation of blood volume to body weight and arterial haemoglobin levels in rabbits.<1. Relative blood volume (ml./kg) of rabbits calculated from total circulating haemoglobin and blood haemoglobin concentration decreases rapidly during the first few weeks of life and more slowly thereafter.2. In anaemic rabbits over 1 kg body weight, relative blood volume is significantly increased.3. Rabbits under 1 kg body weight have larger blood volumes than would be expected from their anaemia alone, were the relationship deduced in rabbits over 1 kg in body weight applicable. Blood volume was not related to haemoglobin concentration in these immature rabbits.<Anemia, Hypochromic, Animals, Blood Volume, Blood Volume Determination, Body Weight, Hemoglobinometry, Hemoglobins, analysis, Rabbits
16050611<Potassium-stimulated respiration and intra-cellular calcium releae in from skeletal muscle.<1. In 1931 Fenn showed that the respiration of frog twitch muscles increases when [K(+)](o) is raised. The present paper is a further study of potassium-stimulated respiration. Stimulation depends on membrane potential, since respiration is also stimulated by elevated [Rb(+)](o) or [Cs(+)](o) in direct relation to their ability to depolarize.2. When [K(+)](o) is elevated to 25 mM there is an increase in respiration which is sustained for hours. If [K(+)](o) is 30 mM or above, there is a transitory burst of stimulated respiration, followed by a decline back to the basal level.3. If [K(+)](o) is raised in steps from 20 to 30 mM, there may never be a burst of increased oxygen consumption. Often a rise in [K(+)](o) from 20 to 24 mM decreases respiration.4. The response to elevated [K(+)](o) can be blocked by divalent cations or by local anaesthetics; the blocking agents do not interfere with the depolarization of the membrane. The blocking agents act rapidly; they probably take effect soon after they contact the cell membrane.5. Either extracellular Ca(2+) or Sr(2+) is important for the stimulation of respiration. The burst produced by 50 mM [K(+)](o) is transformed into a sustained rise in respiration when [Ca(2+)](o) or [Sr(2+)](o) are also raised. If a muscle is stimulated with 25 mM [K(+)](o) in the absence of extracellular calcium, respiration is elevated as usual, but now the rise is transitory unless Ca(2+) or Sr(2+) are added back to the extracellular solution.6. Depolarization seems to stimulate respiration by causing the release of Ca(2+) into the sarcoplasm. Since respiration is increased by a depolarization below the threshold for producing a contracture, respiration is more sensitive than contraction as an indicator of sarcoplasmic calcium concentration.7. A model for the relation between sarcoplasmic calcium and membrane potential is proposed. The model accounts for the time course of the stimulation of respiration and also for much of the available data on potassium contracture. In the model, Ca(2+) is released into the sarcoplasm from a store in the cell. With depolarization, the release of Ca(2+) from the store is increased, but the rate at which extracellular Ca(2+) can replenish the store is decreased. The ability of the longitudinal reticulum to pump Ca(2+) from the sarcoplasm does not vary with membrane potential.<Animals, Anura, Calcium, metabolism, Cell Membrane, drug effects, In Vitro Techniques, Membrane Potentials, drug effects, Muscle Contraction, Muscles, drug effects, metabolism, Oxygen Consumption, Potassium, pharmacology
16050612<Further studies of the metabolism of thyroxine and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine in the guinea-pig.<1. Thyroxine labelled with (125)I and triiodothyronine labelled with (131)I have been administered simultaneously to guinea-pigs and their metabolism studied by whole body counting and measurement of radioactivity in urine, faeces, and blood.2. The half-life of triiodothyronine in the body is about 19 hr, significantly less than that of thyroxine (41 hr).3. After triiodothyronine administration, an unidentified iodinated compound appears in the blood which complicates the estimation of the half-life of this hormone by measurement of the radioactivity in peripheral blood.4. A previous report, based on measurements of blood radioactivity, that the half-lives of the two hormones are similar in the guinea-pig was not confirmed.<Animals, Feces, analysis, Female, Guinea Pigs, Iodine Isotopes, Male, Protein Binding, Radiometry, Thyroxine, blood, metabolism, urine, Triiodothyronine, blood, metabolism, urine
16050614<An electrophysiological study of single vagal efferent units associated with gastric movements in sheep.<1. A method for obtaining reticulo-ruminal movements for up to 19 hr in halothane-anaesthetized sheep is described. The duration, wave form and frequency of the movements resembles those in the conscious animal except that ruminal movements have a lower amplitude.2. A method of recording for up to 5(1/2) hr single efferent unit discharges from fibres presumed to innervate the reticulo-rumen is described.3. At least seven distinguishable types of discharge pattern were recorded. By relating these temporally to movements of the reticulum and rumen it was concluded that Types I, II and III occurred in fibres innervating the reticulum or associated structures, Type IV the rumen and Types V, VI and VII other gastric structures not yet identified. Apart from Type VII units there was no ;resting discharge' in efferent fibres during the quiescent phase of the gastric cycle.4. We conclude that the co-ordination of the complex sequence of gastric movements in ruminant animals is a function of the ;gastric centres' in the hind-brain through their ability to determine the pattern, durations, spike frequencies and temporal interrelationships of discharges in gastric motoneurons innervating the different parts of the forestomach.<Animals, Electrophysiology, Muscle Contraction, Neurons, physiology, Rumen, physiology, Sheep, Stomach, Ruminant, physiology, Vagus Nerve, physiology
16050620<Confirmation from choline acetylase analyses of a massive cholinergic innervation to the rat hippocampus.<1. Unilateral lesions were made in the fimbria of adult rats with a stereotaxically-applied, radio-frequency current. After 3-23 days survival, fresh, unfixed, transverse sections were cut of the forebrain. Half the sections were stained histochemically to show the distribution of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. From the other sections, small, anatomically defined areas were dissected out and assayed for choline acetylase (ChAc) activity (acetyl-CoA: choline-O-acetyltransferase EC2.3.1.6).2. In the fimbria, anterior to the lesion, ChAc activity rises sharply and is still approximately twice the normal after 7 days. In the hippocampus, ChAc activity falls: in most experiments activity on the operated side was 20-40% of that on the control side, but in some experiments values below 10% were obtained. These changes closely parallel those observed in the staining for AChE.3. The results go far towards proving that the hippocampus receives a massive cholinergic innervation via the fimbria. The fibres concerned appear to be those which stain characteristically for AChE and it seems likely that other pathways showing the same histochemical behaviour are also cholinergic.<Acetylcholinesterase, metabolism, Acyltransferases, analysis, Animals, Female, Hippocampus, enzymology, Histocytochemistry, Neurons, cytology, Parasympathetic Nervous System, Rats
16050624<Energetics of cardiac contractions.<1. The average resting heat production of a muscle under zero tension is 24.8 mcal/g muscle .min at 20 degrees C. In the majority of muscles examined the resting heat production increases when the resting tension and muscle length are increased.2. The relation between actively developed tension and heat produced is similar to that existing in skeletal muscle. The plot of heat against developed tension can be obtained either by altering muscle length or by varying the stimulus frequency.3. The mean maximum total efficiency work/(work + heat) in the work experiments was 11.6%. The total energy produced (work + heat) correlates with the load rather than with the work done.4. In isotonic contractions more heat is liberated than the heat versus tension plot predicts. This extra heat is load-dependent.<Animals, Calorimetry, Electric Stimulation, Heart, physiology, In Vitro Techniques, Muscle Contraction, physiology, Myocardium, metabolism, Papillary Muscles, physiology, Rabbits
16050639<Penetration of sugars across the blood-brain barrier.<1. A cerebral perfusion method was used to measure the net uptake of arabinose from the circulatory system in cats.2. There was found to be discrimination between the optical isomers of this substance, with apparently greater uptake of the (-)-form.3. The uptake process was highly temperature dependent, with a Q(10) of 3.0.4. The uptake of arabinose was partially inhibited by 1 mM ouabain perfused concurrently. It was not significantly inhibited by dinitrophenol or phlorrhizin.5. Glucose inhibited competitively the uptake of (-)-arabinose.6. We conclude that the mechanism involved is of the carrier-mediated or of the active transport type, and that at least part of it is shared with glucose and probably other sugars.<Animals, Arabinose, antagonists &amp; inhibitors, metabolism, Biological Transport, Active, Blood-Brain Barrier, Brain, metabolism, Cats, Dinitrophenols, pharmacology, Female, Glucose, pharmacology, Male, Ouabain, pharmacology, Phlorhizin, pharmacology, Temperature
16050643<Effects of water content upon the respiration and the cations of kidney slices.<1. Cortical slices from the kidneys of adult rats were incubated aerobically at 38.5 degrees C in Warburg manometers in an ordinary balanced saline medium and also in ;low-ion' media consisting of 20 mM Tris buffer to which 0-30 g polyethylene glycol (;PEG 6000')/100 ml. was added to control the swelling of the tissue.2. Oxygen uptake in the low ion media containing less than 2 m-equiv/l. of Na(+) and K(+) was maximal when the water content of the slices was kept normal by 14% PEG 6000 in the medium, and was about two thirds of the oxygen consumption in a balanced saline medium.3. Slices respiring in the low-ion media retained potassium in concentrations 10-20 times the concentration in the medium; the ratio of tissue to external concentration of K(+) was inversely related to the water content of the tissue.4. Ratios of K(+)/Na(+) concentration in tissue water were maximal and equal to 10-25 when water content was near normal and the ratio Na(+)/K(+) in the medium was between 1.5 and 2.0.5. Cryoscopic measurements showed that 14% of PEG 6000 contributed 140 m-osmole/kg to the osmolality of the low-ion media in which slices maintained a normal water content.6. It was not possible to interpret the volume of the cells as determined by the balance between the osmotic effect of PEG 6000 in the medium and the colloid osmotic pressure of intracellular proteins.<Animals, Biological Transport, Active, Glycols, pharmacology, In Vitro Techniques, Kidney, analysis, metabolism, Male, Oxygen Consumption, Polyethylenes, pharmacology, Potassium, analysis, Rats, Sodium, analysis, Water-Electrolyte Balance
16050944<Electron-opaque bodies and fat droplets in mouse liver after fasting or glucose injection.<Fasting produces an increased mobilization of lipid from adipose tissue to the liver and a decreased hepatic lipogenesis, but the administration of glucose stimulates lipid synthesis by the liver. After fasting of C3H mice numerous electron-opaque bodies and large lipid droplets were present in the liver. In the liver of untreated controls only a few small electron-opaque bodies and an occasional fat droplet were observed. After glucose injection the number of electron-opaque bodies in the liver was no greater than that observed in livers of saline-injected controls. In the livers of all groups these bodies were located intracellularly within cytoplasmic vesicles; those in extracellular locations were not membrane bounded and were located at indented and thickened hepatocyte plasma membranes or within the space of Disse. In fasted liver the dense bodies were often associated with large fat droplets.<Adipose Tissue, metabolism, Animals, Biological Transport, Cytoplasm, Fasting, Glucose, pharmacology, Golgi Apparatus, Lipids, biosynthesis, Liver, drug effects, metabolism, Male, Mice, Microscopy, Electron
16050945<Schwann cell proliferation in developing mouse sciatic nerve. A radioautographic study.<Proliferation of Schwann cells in neonatal mouse sciatic nerve was studied radioautographically in 1-micro glycol methacrylate sections. 28 mice were injected with thymidine-(3)H, 4 microc/g, 48 hr after birth, and were killed serially over the next 4 days. For the cell cycle following injection, the generation time was approximately 24 hr as determined by grain-count halving data; the duration of synthesis phase was 8 hr as determined from a curve constructed from the per cent of mitotic figures containing label; and the labeling index was 9% at 2 hr after injection. With these estimates, the per cent of Schwann cells proliferating was calculated to be 27%. In addition, roughly 25% of dividing cells appeared to cease division during the cell cycle under study. The relationship of these findings to other events during maturation of nerve is discussed.<Animals, Animals, Newborn, Autoradiography, Cell Nucleus, Mice, Mitosis, physiology, Schwann Cells, physiology, Sciatic Nerve, Thymidine, metabolism, Tritium
16050946<Acid phosphatase localization in rabbit eosinophils.<Eosinophil (and heterophil) leukocytes of glycogen-induced rabbit peritoneal exudates were fixed for 1(1/2) min in 2% glutaraldehyde and examined for acid phosphatase activity both biochemically and cytochemically. Biochemical assays showed that enzymatic activity had been inhibited by only approximately 10% under these conditions. The cytochemical reaction in the eosinophil was confined to the granules in which the reaction product appeared in the matrix, not in the crystalline core (or in the core region after the latter's extraction). Granules wherein the matrix was disrupted and the crystalline core degraded or extracted showed the most intense deposition of reaction product, whereas well preserved granules with morphologically intact matrix and crystals were unreactive. Yet, not all disrupted granules gave a positive reaction, indicating that disruption was a necessary but not sufficient condition for reactivity. In many eosinophil leukocytes, most if not all granules were acid phosphatase-positive, provided they had become disrupted to a certain degree. Factors possibly involved in converting the granules from an unreactive to a reactive state are discussed.<Acid Phosphatase, metabolism, Animals, Cytoplasmic Granules, Eosinophils, enzymology, Histocytochemistry, Microscopy, Electron, Rabbits
16050947<Tubular and fibrillar components of mature and differentiating sieve elements.<An ontogenetic study of the sieve element protoplast of Nicotiana tabacum L. by light and electron microscopy has shown that the P-protein component (slime) arises as small groups of tubules in the cytoplasm. These subsequently enlarge to form comparatively large compact masses of 231 +/- 2.5 (SE)A (n = 121) tubules, the P-protein bodies. During subsequent differentiation of the sieve element, the P-protein body disaggregates and the tubules become dispersed throughout the cell. This disaggregation occurs at about the same stage of differentiation of the sieve elements as the breakdown of the tonoplast and nucleus. Later, the tubules of P-protein are reorganized into smaller striated 149 +/- 4.5 (SE)A (n = 43) fibrils which are characteristic of the mature sieve elements. The tubular P-protein component has been designated P1-protein and the striated fibrillar component P2-protein. In fixed material, the sieve-plate pores of mature sieve elements are filled with proteinaceous material which frays out into the cytoplasm as striated fibrils of P2-protein. Our observations are compatible with the view that the contents of contiguous mature sieve elements, including the P-protein, are continuous through the sieve-plate pores and that fixing solutions denature the proteins in the pores. They are converted into the electron-opaque material filling the pores.<Cell Differentiation, Cytoplasm, Microscopy, Electron, Plant Cells, Plant Proteins, metabolism, Protoplasts
16050948<Models of muscle Z-band fine structure based on a looping filament configuration.<The fine architecture of skeletal muscle Z bands is considered in view of stereo electron microscopical evidence and current biochemical and immunological concepts, and a new Z-band model is proposed. This model is based on a looping, interlinking configuration, within the Z band, of strands which emanate from I-band (actin) filaments of adjacent sarcomeres. Two versions of the model seem presently feasible: one in which the Z-band lattice is composed of actin loops; and another in which the same pattern is derived from tropomyosin. Either version satisfies actual electron micrograph images as well as or better than prior Z-band models. Moreover, the principle of looping linkage in filament-to-filament attachment can be related to similar filament patterns seen in several adhesion sites where intracellular filaments insert on cell membranes.<Animals, Cell Membrane, Endoplasmic Reticulum, Microscopy, Electron, Models, Structural, Muscle Proteins, Muscles, cytology, Urodela
16050949<Studies on the maintenance of oral development in Tetrahymena pyriformis GL-C. II. The relationship of protein synthesis to cell division and oral organelle development.<The effects of puromycin on synchronized Tetrahymena pyriformis were investigated at two different concentrations, 43 microg per ml and 430 microg per ml. The rate of incorporation of histidine-(14)C into hot TCA-insoluble material was reduced by 30% at the low concentration and by 80-90% at the high concentration. The rate of oxygen uptake was lowered by only 10-20% at both concentrations. Cell division was prevented at both concentrations, if the drug was added prior to a "transition point" at about 45 min after the end of the synchronizing treatment. Development of "anarchic field" oral primordia was arrested, while primordia in early stages of membranelle differentiation were resorbed. Resorption began shortly after addition of the drug, and proceeded most rapidly at the lower concentration. If the drug was added after the "transition point," cell division and oral primordium formation were completed with only slight delay at the low concentration, and with considerable delay (in some cases complete arrest) at the high concentration. The results thus indicate that protein synthesis is involved in the later as well as the earlier stages of development; what specially characterizes the earlier stages, prior to the "transition point," is a dramatic response to partial inhibition of protein synthesis. It is suggested that this response involves the activation or release of a latent intracellular degradative system which is specific for developing structures.<Amino Acids, metabolism, Animals, Carbon Isotopes, Histidine, metabolism, Mitosis, drug effects, Organoids, growth &amp; development, Oxygen Consumption, Protein Biosynthesis, Puromycin, pharmacology, Tetrahymena, drug effects
16050968<Ion fluxes and short-circuit current in internally perfused cells of Valonia ventricosa.<Ion transport in the giant celled marine alga, Valonia ventricosa, was studied during internal perfusion and short-circuiting of the vacuole potential. The perfusing and bathing solutions were similar to natural Valonia sap and contained the following concentrations of major ions: Na 51, K 618, and Cl 652 mM. The average short-circuit current (I(sc)) was 97 pEq/cm(2) sec (inward positive current), and the average open-circuit potential difference (PD) was 74 mv (vacuole positive to external solution). Perfused and short-circuited cells showed a small net influx of Na (2.0 pEq/cm(2) sec) and large net influxes of K (80 pEq/cm(2) sec) and Cl (50 pEq/cm(2) sec). Unidirectional K influx was proportional to I(sc), but more than one-half of the I(sc) remained unaccounted for. Both the I(sc) and PD were partly light-dependent, declining rapidly during the first 1-2 min of darkness. Ouabain (5 x 10(-4)M) had little effect on the influx of Na or K and had no effect on I(inf) or PD. Fluid was absorbed at a rate of about 93 pliter/cm(2) sec. Reversing the direction of fluid movement by adding mannitol to the outside solution had little effect on ion movements.

16050969<Effects of some inhibitors on the temperature-dependent component of resting potential in lobster axon.<The resting membrane potential of the lobster axon becomes 5-8 mv more negative when the temperature of the perfusion solution is increased 10 degrees C. This potential change is about twice that predicted if the axon membrane potential followed that expected for a potassium ion electrode potential. When the inhibitors, 2, 4-dinitrophenol, sodium cyanide, and sodium azide, were added separately to the perfusion medium the potential change was reduced to about 1.4 times that predicted for a potassium ion electrode potential. Assays of axons exposed to these inhibitors showed that ATP levels were reduced to about one-fourth that obtained for control axons. Ouabain added to the perfusion medium reduced the potential change to that expected for a potassium ion electrode potential. These results suggest that the resting potential changes with temperature as a result of the activity of an electrogenic ion pump.<Adenosine Triphosphate, metabolism, Animals, Axons, drug effects, physiology, Azides, pharmacology, Crustacea, physiology, Cyanides, pharmacology, Dinitrophenols, pharmacology, Electrophysiology, instrumentation, Membrane Potentials, drug effects, Ouabain, pharmacology, Perfusion, Potassium, metabolism, Proteins, metabolism, Temperature
16050970<In vivo effect of uncoupling agents on the incorporation of calcium and strontium into mitochondria and other subcellular fractions of rat liver.<After injection of (45)Ca(++) or (89)Sr(++) into rats, the largest part of the radioactivity in the liver cell is associated with the subcellular structures, only negligible amounts of it being found in the soluble hyaloplasm. 50 % or more of the (45)Ca(++) and (89)Sr(++) in the liver cell is recovered in the mitochondrial fraction. The specific activity of Ca(++) after injection of (45)Ca(++) is far greater in mitochondria than in microsomes. Pretreatment of the rats with uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation markedly decreases the amount of radioactivity associated with the mitochondrial fraction. The amount of radioactivity recovered in the microsomes and in the final supernatant on the contrary increases. These effects are present only when mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is completely uncoupled. The Ca(++) content of mitochondria from the livers of rats pretreated with uncouplers is sharply decreased with respect to the controls. It is concluded that in the liver cells of the intact animal energy-linked movements of Ca(++) and Sr(++) take place in mitochondria.<Animals, Calcium, metabolism, Calcium Isotopes, Dinitrophenols, pharmacology, Energy Transfer, Liver, drug effects, Male, Microsomes, metabolism, Mitochondria, Liver, metabolism, Oxidative Phosphorylation, Phenols, pharmacology, Rats, Strontium, metabolism, Strontium Isotopes
16050971<Junctional membrane uncoupling. Permeability transformations at a cell membrane junction.<The permeability of the membrane surfaces where cells are in contact (junctional membranes) in Chironomus salivary glands depends on Ca(++) and Mg(++). When the concentration of these ions at the junctional membranes is raised sufficiently, these normally highly permeable membranes seal off; their permeability falls one to three orders, as they approach the nonjunctional membranes in conductance. This permeability transformation is achieved in three ways: (a) by iontophoresis of Ca(++) into the cell; (b) by entry of Ca(++) and/or Mg(++) from the extracellular fluid into the cell through leaks in the cell surface membrane (e.g., injury); or (c) by entry of these ions through leaks arising, probably primarily in the perijunctional insulation, due to trypsin digestion, anisotonicity, alkalinity, or chelation. Ca(++) and Mg(++) appear to have three roles in the junctional coupling processes: (a) in the permeability of the junctional membranes; (b) in the permeability of the perijunctional insulation; and (c) a role long known- in the mechanical stability of the cell junction. The two latter roles may well be closely interdependent, but the first is clearly independent of the others.<Animals, Biological Transport, Calcium, metabolism, Cell Membrane, physiology, Cell Membrane Permeability, drug effects, Diptera, anatomy &amp; histology, Electrophysiology, instrumentation, Iontophoresis, Magnesium, metabolism, Membrane Potentials, drug effects, Models, Theoretical, Salivary Glands
16050972<Absorption and screening in Phycomyces.<In vivo absorption measurements were made through the photosensitive zones of Phycomyces sporangiophores and absorption spectra are presented for various growth media and for wavelengths between 400 and 580 mmicro. As in mycelia, beta-carotene was the major pigment ordinarily found. The addition of diphenylamine to the growth media caused a decrease in beta-carotene and an increase in certain other carotenoids. Growth in the dark substantially reduced the amount of beta-carotene in the photosensitive zone; however, growth on a lactate medium failed to suppress beta-carotene in the growing zone although the mycelia appeared almost colorless. Also when diphenylamine was added to the medium the absorption in the growing zone at 460 mmicro was not diminished although the colored carotenoids in the bulk of the sporangiophore were drastically reduced. Absorption which is characteristic of the action spectra was not found. Sporangiophores immersed in fluids with a critical refractive index show neither positive nor negative tropism. Measurements were made of the critical refractive indices for light at 495 and 510 mmicro. The critical indices differed only slightly. Assuming primary photoreceptors at the cell wall, the change in screening due to absorption appears too large to be counterbalanced solely by a simple effect of the focusing change. The possibility is therefore advanced that the receptors are internal to most of the cytoplasm; i.e., near the vacuole.<Carotenoids, analysis, Cell Membrane, Cytoplasm, Darkness, Fungi, analysis, Light, Spectrophotometry
16050973<Evidence for carrier-mediated transport of monosaccharides in the Ehrlich ascites tumor cell.<Evidence for carrier-mediated transport of monosaccharides in the Ehrlich ascites tumor cells was provided through kinetic analysis of data obtained by: (a) studying sugar uptake by dilute cell suspensions with an optical densimetric apparatus, (b) studying sugar uptake by thicker cell suspensions by means of direct chemical analytical methods using packed cell plugs, (c) observing the effects of a competitive inhibitor upon sugar uptake with the chemical analytical method, and (d) measurement of tracer uptake of a high affinity sugar in thick cell suspensions in the absence of net movement. Quantitative application of the data obtained with the above experimental procedures to theoretical model systems derived for both carrier-mediated transport and simple passive diffusion indicated that the results were consonant with predictions for the carrier-mediated transport model, but could not be explained on the basis of uncomplicated diffusion.<Animals, Biological Transport, physiology, Carbon Isotopes, Carcinoma, Ehrlich Tumor, metabolism, Cell Membrane Permeability, Female, Mice, Models, Theoretical, Monosaccharides, metabolism
16050974<Relative ion permeabilities in the crayfish giant axon determined from rapid external ion changes.<The changes in membrane potential of isolated, single crayfish giant axons following rapid shifts in external ion concentrations have been studied. At normal resting potential the immediate change in membrane potential after a variation in external potassium concentration is quite marked compared to the effect of an equivalent chloride change. If the membrane is depolarized by a maintained potassium elevation, the immediate potential change due to a chloride variation becomes comparable to that of an equivalent potassium change. There is no appreciable effect on membrane potential when external sodium is varied, at normal or at a depolarized membrane potential. Starting from the constant field equation, expressions for the permeability ratios P(Cl)/P(K), P(Na)/P(K), and for intracellular potassium and chloride concentrations are derived. At normal resting membrane potential, P(Cl)/P(K) is 0.13 but at a membrane potential of -53 mv (external potassium level increased about five times) it is 0.85. The intracellular concentrations of potassium and chloride are estimated to be 233 and 34 mM, respectively, and it is pointed out that this is not compatible with ions distributed in a Nernst equilibrium across the membrane. It is also stressed that the information given by a plot of membrane potential vs. the logarithm of external potassium concentrations is very limited and rests upon several important assumptions.<Animals, Axons, drug effects, Biological Transport, Cell Membrane Permeability, drug effects, Chlorides, pharmacology, Crustacea, physiology, Electrophysiology, instrumentation, Membrane Potentials, drug effects, Models, Theoretical, Potassium, pharmacology, Sodium, pharmacology
16051338<Arginine biosynthesis by Streptococcus bovis.<The pathway of arginine biosynthesis in Streptococcus bovis was studied by radioactive tracer techniques. Cells were grown anaerobically with (14)CO(2) in a synthetic medium containing NH(4) (+) as the sole nitrogen source except for the trace present in nitrogen-containing vitamins. The protein fraction isolated from the labeled cells was acid-hydrolyzed, and (14)C-arginine was isolated from the protein hydrolysate by ion-exchange chromatography. The carboxyl carbon of the isolated arginine was removed with arginine decarboxylase, and the guanidino carbon was removed by simultaneous arginase-urease degradation. By manometric measurement and liquid scintillation counting of the CO(2) released by enzymatic degradation, 50% of the label was found in the carboxyl carbon and 50% in the guanidino carbon. Specific radioactivity determinations indicated that growth on (14)CO(2) resulted in twice as much label in arginine as with aspartate, glutamate, or lysine. These results are consistent with a glutamate --&gt; ornithine --&gt; citrulline pathway of arginine biosynthesis in S. bovis and provide further evidence for the synthesis of glutamate via the tricarboxylic acid cycle reactions from citrate through alpha-ketoglutarate.<Ammonium Chloride, metabolism, Arginine, analysis, biosynthesis, Aspartic Acid, analysis, Carbon Dioxide, metabolism, Carbon Isotopes, Chromatography, Ion Exchange, Citric Acid Cycle, Glutamates, analysis, Lysine, analysis, Protein Hydrolysates, analysis, Streptococcus, metabolism
16051339<Regulation of glutamine synthetase. V. Partial purification and properties of glutamine synthetase from Bacillus licheniformis.<The glutamine synthetase of Bacillus licheniformis has been obtained at about 15% purity. Sucrose gradient centrifugation gave a molecular weight value of approximately 612,000. Both l- and d-glutamate can be utilized as substrates in the biosynthetic reaction, although the l isomer was five times more active. The requirement for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) can be partially replaced by guanosine or inosine triphosphates, but not by cytidine or uridine triphosphates. The Mn(++) was required for activity, and the requirement cannot be satisfied with Mg(++). Maximal activity of the biosynthetic reaction was observed when ATP and Mn(++) were present in equimolar amounts. An excess of either reactant gave less activity. However, other purine and pyrimidine nucleotides, when added in combination with ATP, can partially substitute for ATP in attaining the equimolar ratio of nucleotide to Mn(++). A complex of ATP and Mn(++) is the preferred form of substrate. The B. licheniformis enzyme catalyzes the glutamyl transfer reaction but at a much slower rate than the Escherichia coli glutamine synthetase. Either adenosine diphosphate (ADP) or ATP can activate the glutamotransferase, although ADP is more active.<Acyltransferases, metabolism, Adenine Nucleotides, pharmacology, Ammonium Chloride, pharmacology, Aspartic Acid, metabolism, Bacillus, enzymology, Centrifugation, Density Gradient, Cytosine Nucleotides, pharmacology, Electrophoresis, Glutamates, metabolism, pharmacology, Glutamine, Guanine Nucleotides, pharmacology, Hydroxamic Acids, biosynthesis, Ligases, analysis, metabolism, Magnesium, pharmacology, Manganese, pharmacology, Nucleotides, pharmacology, Pyruvate Kinase, pharmacology, Pyruvates, pharmacology, Uracil Nucleotides, pharmacology
16051340<Regulation of glutamine synthetase. VI. Interactions of inhibitors for Bacillus licheniformis glutamine synthetase.<The relationships of five feedback inhibitors for the Bacillus licheniformis glutamine synthetase were investigated. The inhibitors were distinguishable by differences in their competitive relationship for the substrates of the enzyme. Mixtures of l-glutamine and adenosine-5'-monophosphate (AMP) or histidine and AMP caused synergistic inhibition of glutamine synthesis. Histidine, alanine, and glycine acted antagonistically toward the l-glutamine inhibition. Alanine acted antagonistically toward the glycine and histidine inhibitions. Independence of inhibitory action was observed with the other pairs of effectors. Possible mechanisms by which the inhibitors may interact to control glutamine synthesis are discussed. The low rate of catalysis of the glutamyl transfer reaction by the B. licheniformis glutamine synthetase can be attributed to the fact that l-glutamine serves both as a substrate and an inhibitor for the enzyme. Effectors which act antagonistically toward the l-glutamine inhibition stimulated glutamotransferase activity. The stimulation was not observed when d-glutamine was used as substrate for the glutamyl transfer reaction.<Acyltransferases, metabolism, Adenine Nucleotides, pharmacology, Alanine, pharmacology, Ammonium Chloride, pharmacology, Asparagine, pharmacology, Aspartic Acid, pharmacology, Bacillus, enzymology, Carbamates, pharmacology, Drug Antagonism, Drug Synergism, Feedback, Glutamates, pharmacology, Glutamine, pharmacology, Glycine, pharmacology, Histidine, pharmacology, Hydroxamic Acids, biosynthesis, Isoleucine, pharmacology, Kinetics, Ligases, antagonists &amp; inhibitors
16051341<Metabolism of pipecolic acid in a Pseudomonas species. V. Pipecolate oxidase and dehydrogenase.<Oxidation of pipecolate to Delta(1)-piperideine-6-carboxylate is catalyzed by pipecolate oxidase, an inducible, membrane-bound dehydrogenase associated with the electron transport components of Pseudomonas putida P2. From the oxidase, we obtained a smaller particle containing flavine adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and cytochrome b, but no longer able to catalyze electron transfer to oxygen or to cytochrome c. Certain properties of this l-pipecolate dehydrogenase, an FAD-flavoprotein, are reported.<Cytochromes, pharmacology, Electrolytes, pharmacology, Electron Transport, Flavin-Adenine Dinucleotide, pharmacology, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Oxidoreductases, analysis, antagonists &amp; inhibitors, metabolism, Oxygen, metabolism, Pipecolic Acids, metabolism, Piperidines, biosynthesis, Proteins, pharmacology, Pseudomonas, enzymology, metabolism, Quinacrine, pharmacology
16051342<Mechanism of bacterial pyrite oxidation.<The oxidation by Ferrobacillus ferrooxidans of untreated pyrite (FeS(2)) as well as HCl-pretreated pyrite (from which most of the acid-soluble iron species were removed) was studied manometrically. Oxygen uptake was linear during bacterial oxidation of untreated pyrite, whereas with HCl-pretreated pyrite both a decrease in oxygen uptake at 2 hr and nonlinear oxygen consumption were observed. Ferric sulfate added to HCl-pretreated pyrite restored approximately two-thirds of the decrease in total bacterial oxygen uptake and caused oxygen uptake to revert to nearly linear kinetics. Ferric sulfate also oxidized pyrite in the absence of bacteria and O(2); recovery of ferric and ferrous ions was in excellent agreement with the reaction Fe(2)(SO(4))(3) + FeS(2) = 3FeSO(4) + 2S, but the elemental sulfur produced was negligible. Neither H(2)S nor S(2)O(3) (2-) was a product of the reaction. It is probable that two mechanisms of bacterial pyrite oxidation operate concurrently: the direct contact mechanism which requires physical contact between bacteria and pyrite particles for biological pyrite oxidation, and the indirect contact mechanism according to which the bacteria oxidize ferrous ions to the ferric state, thereby regenerating the ferric ions required for chemical oxidation of pyrite.<Bacteria, metabolism, Chlorides, pharmacology, Hydrochloric Acid, pharmacology, Iron, metabolism, pharmacology, Oxidation-Reduction, Oxygen, metabolism, Sulfates, pharmacology, Sulfides, metabolism, Sulfur, metabolism
16051343<Homoaconitic acid accumulation by a lysine-requiring yeast mutant.<Homoaconitic acid, the second intermediate of the proposed pathway for lysine biosynthesis in yeast, is accumulated in the growth medium of a lysine-requiring mutant. This acid has been identified on paper and column chromatography by comparing it with authentic cis-homoaconitic acid. The infrared spectrum of the isolated material was identical with that of synthetic cis-homoaconitic acid. In addition, the chemical structure of the enzymatic product has been verified by degradation to glyoxylic and alpha-ketoglutaric acids after treatment with KMnO(4) and HIO(4) and by catalytic reduction to the saturated acid 1,2,4-butanetricarboxylic acid. The isolated homoaconitic acid was also identified as a substrate for a purified enzyme preparation of homoaconitase.<Acids, biosynthesis, Carbon Isotopes, Chemical Phenomena, Chemistry, Citric Acid Cycle, Glucose, metabolism, Lysine, biosynthesis, Mutation, Yeasts, metabolism
16051344<Regeneration of ribosomes and ribosomal ribonucleic acid during repair of thermal injury to Staphylococcus.<Heating Staphylococcus aureus MF31 at 55 C for 15 min renders the organisms unable to reproduce on agar containing 7.5% NaCl (1). The heated organisms exhibited an extended lag period during which the organisms regained their ability to grow on the 7.5% NaCl-agar. Inhibitor and antibiotic data indicated that protein synthesis is not involved in this recovery process but nucleic acid synthesis is suggested (3). The data presented here further substantiate the noninvolvement of protein synthesis during recovery and further demonstrate the site of the thermally induced nucleic acid lesion. Methylated albumin kieselguhr column analysis showed the lesion site to be the ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA). The rRNA is resynthesized during the extended lag period. Sucrose gradient analysis demonstrated that a ribosomal peak was undetectable subsequent to the thermal treatment, but this peak was regenerated during the recovery period.<Bacterial Proteins, biosynthesis, Carbon Isotopes, Centrifugation, Zonal, Chromatography, Glutamates, metabolism, Hot Temperature, RNA, Bacterial, biosynthesis, metabolism, Ribosomes, Staphylococcus, growth &amp; development, Tritium, Tryptophan, pharmacology, Uracil, metabolism

Their identification as ad-7 mutants was assessed in relation to two previously mapped ad-7 mutants. Each mutant was found to occupy a distinct mutational site; the smallest recombination fraction observed between the two closest mutational sites was of the order of 0.5 x 10(-6).<Adenine, metabolism, Ascomycota, drug effects, Chromosome Mapping, Hydroxylamines, pharmacology, Mutation, Recombination, Genetic, Sulfonic Acids, pharmacology
16051346<Preparation and chemical composition of the cell walls of mature infectious dense forms of meningopneumonitis organisms.<Relatively large-scale production and purification of meningopneumonitis organisms was developed for chemical and immunological studies on cell walls of the infectious dense forms. By disruption of purified organisms with glass beads in a Mickle shaker, highly purified preparations of cell walls were obtained by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, enzyme digestion, and sodium dodecyl sulfate treatment. The dry-weight recovery of purified cell walls from intact organisms was about 13%. When (32)P-labeled preparations of cell walls were fractionated into acid-soluble, lipid, ribonucleic acid (RNA), deoxyribonucleic (DNA), and residual fractions, about 80% of the (32)P in cell wall preparations was recovered in the phospholipid fraction, which corresponded to about 3% of the total phospholipid in the intact organisms. About 7% of the (32)P in purified cell walls was recovered in the RNA and DNA fractions respectively, but this corresponds to only about 0.4% of the (32)P found in those fractions in intact organisms. From dry-weight determinations, it was calculated that the purified cell wall preparations contained only 0.6% total nucleic acids, and these are probably not true cell wall constituents. These cell walls contained 70 to 75% protein, corresponding to about 14% of the protein in intact organisms. Amino acid analysis of these protein showed the existence of all common amino acids, glucosamine, and galactosamine. However, no muramic acid was detected by the methods employed.<Acids, analysis, Amino Acids, analysis, Bacterial Proteins, analysis, Cell Wall, analysis, Centrifugation, Density Gradient, Chlamydia, cytology, DNA, Bacterial, analysis, Hexosamines, analysis, Lipids, analysis, Microscopy, Electron, Phospholipids, analysis, Phosphorus Isotopes, RNA, Bacterial, analysis
16051347<Preparation and chemical composition of the cell membranes of developmental reticulate forms of meningopneumonitis organisms.<The outer limiting membranes of developmental reticulate forms of the meningopneumonitis organism were purified by a combination of differential centrifugation, trypsin digestion, and sodium dodecyl sulfate treatment, and their physical and chemical properties were compared with those of outer envelopes of mature dense forms of this organism. Reticulate bodies were easily disrupted by short periods of sonic treatment and were lysed by trysin digestion, in contrast to the dense bodies which were resistant to these treatments. In electron micrographs, reticulate body membranes were seen as very thin, flattened structures, whereas dense-body envelopes showed folding rigid membranes. The results of chemical fractionation of (32)P-labeled purified preparations indicated that reticulate body membranes have smaller amounts of phospholipid, and are more dense than cell walls of the mature forms. The analysis of amino acid composition of reticulate body cell membranes showed that they do not contain cystine or methionine, both of which were found in cell walls of dense bodies. These results clearly show that there are significant differences in the chemical and physical properties of the outer envelopes of the developmental and mature forms of this organism.<Acids, analysis, Amino Acids, analysis, Cell Membrane, analysis, Chlamydia, cytology, DNA, Bacterial, analysis, Lipids, analysis, Mercaptoethanol, pharmacology, Microscopy, Electron, Muramidase, pharmacology, Papain, pharmacology, Phosphorus Isotopes, RNA, Bacterial, analysis, Sulfates, pharmacology, Trypsin, pharmacology, Ultrasonics

16051356<Factors affecting reproducibility of numerical classifications.<Results obtained with reference organisms which had been included in each of three different investigations were compared. Positions of the reference organisms in diagrams based on highest-link numerical groupings varied with the composition of the microbial samples studied, but significant correlations were found between the results of different investigations. Correlations between the overall groupings obtained in different studies were often better than the correlations between actual similarity values computed between specific pairs of organisms. Similarity values based on different sets of features showed significant correlations, regardless of the kinds of features involved or of the number of features (above a minimum of about 40). Correlations between values based on totally different features were nearly as good as those between values based on similar features which had been determined by different investigators.<Bacteria, classification, Methods
16051357<Induced phenotypic resistance to valine in Mycobacterium pellegrino.<Valine coordinately increases the levels of three of the enzymes participating in the biosynthesis of isoleucine and valine in Mycobacterium pellegrino. The amount of valine required for end-product induction depends on the condition of the cells. Isoleucine inhibits the effect of valine. Acetohydroxy acid synthetase, the enzyme catalyzing the first common step in the biosynthesis of valine and isoleucine, is inhibited by valine. The induction effect of valine appears to be due to its ability to inhibit the activity of this enzyme, thus causing isoleucine deficiency, which in turn leads to derepression. This conclusion is supported by the fact that valine, under certain conditions, inhibits growth.<Enzyme Repression, Hydro-Lyases, metabolism, Isoleucine, biosynthesis, pharmacology, Leucine, biosynthesis, pharmacology, Ligases, metabolism, Mycobacterium, enzymology, Valine, biosynthesis, pharmacology
16051358<Effect of thiosulfate on the photosynthetic growth of Rhodopseudomonas palustris.<Cell yields of Rhodopseudomonas palustris grown photoheterotrophically in pyruvate-mineral salts medium were increased by the photooxidation of added thiosulfate. However, thiosulfate had no effect on cell yields of cultures grown aerobically in darkness, although thiosulfate was also oxidized. The presence of thiosulfate increased photosynthetic cell yields on a variety of other organic substrates. Growth of cells in thiosulfate-containing medium, or the addition of thiosulfate to cells grown in thiosulfate-free medium, induced the formation of a thiosulfate-oxidizing system which quantitatively photooxidized thiosulfate to sulfate. R. palustris grew photoautotrophically with thiosulfate as an oxidizable substrate. Large amounts of supplemental bicarbonate carbon were incorporated when cells were grown photosynthetically in pyruvate-thiosulfate medium. Cells harvested after photoautotrophic or photoheterotrophic growth in fumarate-thiosulfate medium fixed (14)CO(2) at an 8- to 10-fold greater rate when provided with thiosulfate. The evolution of (14)CO(2) from pyruvate-1-(14)C during photoassimilation by R. palustris was greatly suppressed by the presence of thiosulfate. The increase in photoheterotrophic cell yields of R. palustris caused by the oxidation of thiosulfate may result from assimilation of substrate carbon which is normally evolved as carbon dioxide.<Bicarbonates, metabolism, Carbon Dioxide, biosynthesis, metabolism, Carbon Isotopes, Culture Media, Darkness, Fumarates, metabolism, Light, Photosynthesis, drug effects, Pyruvates, metabolism, Rhodopseudomonas, growth &amp; development, Sulfates, biosynthesis, Thiosulfates, metabolism, pharmacology
16051359<Comparative cell wall analyses of morphological forms within the genus Actinomyces.<Comparative cell wall analyses were made of mycelial and smooth forms of Actinomyces bovis and A. israelii to determine the changes which occur in the cell wall composition concurrent with a change in morphology, and to evaluate cell wall analyses as a criterion for taxonomic identification within the genus Actinomyces. Cell walls of the spider forms of A. boyis had little or no aspartic acid and a high hexosamine concentration; cell walls of the smooth forms had a high aspartic acid content and low concentrations of hexosamine. Both forms had large amounts of glutamic acid, alanine, and lysine, as previously reported. A strain of Actinomyces, previously identified as A. naeslundii on the basis of morphology and aerobic growth characteristics, was found to have the basic cell wall composition of A. israelii. When transferred from the Actinomyces maintenance broth to a thioglycolate broth, the cells of this strain passed from a mycelial form through a transient filamentous morphology to become diphtheroidal with continued incubation. Concomitantly, the concentrations of glutamic acid relative to alanine decreased, and the hexosamine content increased. Variation in morphology within the species A. israelii and A. bovis could not be related to any mutual chemical change of their cell walls.<Actinomyces, analysis, classification, cytology, Amino Acids, analysis, Carbohydrates, analysis, Cell Wall, analysis, Culture Media, Hexosamines, analysis

The psychrophiles formed four distinct groups which were sufficiently different from the mesophiles to warrant their designation as new species of Bacillus.

16051361<Influence of cellular factors on immune unresponsiveness induced by Klebsiella pneumoniae capsular antigen.<The mechanisms by which immune unresponsiveness (immune paralysis) develops are still uncertain. The present work was based on the assumption that this condition may be due to failure of certain activities of the macrophages. Data from passive transfer of such cells are interpreted as supporting this hypothesis. Purified capsular polysaccharide from type 2 Klebsiella pneumoniae induced immunity when given to Swiss albino mice in 5-mug amounts and immune paralysis when given in 1,000-mug amounts. The unresponsive state lapsed to that of acquired immunity 3 months after induction. Passive transfer of cells from groups of K. pneumoniae immune, "paralyzed," and control mice showed that peritoneal cells from "paralyzed" donors induced significant protection against challenge in both control and "paralyzed" recipients. In contrast, spleen cells from control, "paralyzed," and immune animals failed to effect such transfer. The finding that unresponsiveness could be terminated by peritoneal cells and not spleen cells indicates that macrophages played a primary role in immune paralysis, possibly owing to their loss of capacity to transfer factors or information for induction of antibody synthesis.<Animals, Antibody Formation, Female, Immune Tolerance, Immunity, Immunity, Maternally-Acquired, Klebsiella Infections, immunology, Macrophages, immunology, Mice, Peritoneum, immunology, Polysaccharides, Bacterial, pharmacology, Spleen, immunology

Cellular immunity and its antibody in mouse mononuclear phagocytes.<A cell-associated antibody was detected in the peritoneal mononuclear phagocytes (referred to as monocytes) of mice hyperimmunized with live vaccine of Salmonella enteritidis, by use of immune transfer and immune adherence hemagglutination techniques. The cellular antibody inhibited the growth of a virulent strain of S. enteritidis with the aid of complement and lysozyme on nutrient agar plates. This type of bactericidal antibody could not be detected in the monocytes of mice immunized with killed vaccine of S. enteritidis.

Induction of cellular immunity and formation of antibody by transfer agent of mouse mononuclear phagocytes.<When mice were injected intraperitoneally with a ribonucleic acid (RNA) preparation extracted from the peritoneal mononuclear phagocytes (termed monocytes) of immunized mice, these macrophages developed cellular immunity and cellular antibodies. The peritoneal monocytes were obtained from normal mice and maintained in tissue culture bottles in a homogeneous cell population. When they were treated in vitro with an immune RNA preparation, they acquired cellular immunity, and cellular antibodies were detectable in such monocytes. These results suggest that the mononuclear phagocytic cell line constitutes a cell line responsible for antibody formation.<Animals, Antibody Formation, Female, Immunity, Maternally-Acquired, In Vitro Techniques, Male, Mice, Monocytes, immunology, RNA, pharmacology, Salmonella, growth &amp; development, Salmonella Infections, Animal, immunology
16051364<Resistance of vaccinated mice to typical and atypical strains of Coccidioides immitis.<In earlier reports, it was shown that mice and monkeys could be immunized against otherwise lethal challenge doses of Coccidioides immitis arthrospores. The vaccine was composed of Formalin-killed, in vitro grown, endosporulating spherules of C. immitis strain Silveira. In this study, mice were immunized as in the earlier work and then challenged intranasally with arthrospores from seven heterologous strains of C. immitis. Two of these strains were typical of the species, and five were atypical with respect to their cultural characteristics and morphology of microscopic structures. The vaccinated animals were well protected against challenge doses that were lethal to a majority of the control animals, regardless of the strain of fungus employed. The infection ratios among surviving vaccinated and control animals were comparable, but demonstrable lesions were generally smaller and less numerous in the vaccinated groups. It is suggested that these strains are at least immunogenically similar, although not necessarily identical, and that a vaccine prepared from a single strain of C. immitis would be practical for an immunization program.<Animals, Coccidioides, classification, Coccidioidomycosis, immunology, Female, Fungal Vaccines, pharmacology, Immunity, Active, Male, Mice
16051365<Experimental study of the pathogenicity of aspergilli for mice.<The relative virulence was determined for 14 species of aspergilli, by inoculating normal mice intravenously with graded doses of spores. Eleven were found to possess some degree of virulence, whereas three others were avirulent. Members of the Aspergillus flavus group were the only species that consistently killed mice with doses as low as 10(4) viable spores. When the in vivo fate of spores was compared for a virulent and an avirulent strain of Aspergillus, spores of the latter were cleared rapidly from the liver and spleen but grew in the kidneys and brain, producing progressive disease. Mice which inhaled spores did not succumb, but macrophages washed from their lungs contained spores. A relationship of virulence to spore characteristics such as germination time, size, shape, and external markings could not be established. Virulence could not be related to aflatoxin production inasmuch as at least one virulent strain did not produce aflatoxin in vitro.<Aerosols, pharmacology, Aflatoxins, biosynthesis, Animals, Aspergillosis, mortality, Aspergillus, pathogenicity, Brain Chemistry, Dosage Forms, Injections, Intravenous, Kidney, analysis, Liver, analysis, Lung, analysis, Macrophages, analysis, Male, Mice, Myocardium, analysis, Spleen, analysis, Spores, analysis, pathogenicity, Virulence
16051486<The world outlook for conventional agriculture. More emphasis is needed on farm price policy and plant research if future world food needs are to be met.<1) The worldwide demand for food will continue to be strong in the coming decades. Two forces-rapidly growing population and, in much of the world, rapidly rising incomes-are expected to result in increases in the demand for food even more rapid than those that have occurred during the past. 2) Conventional agriculture has assured an adequate food supply for the economically advanced one-third of the world. The challenge now is to assure an adequate food supply for the remaining two-thirds, where population is now increasing at the rate of 1 million people per week and where malnutrition is already widespread. 3) Economically feasible prospects for significantly expanding the world's area of cultivated land in the 1960's and 1970's are limited and largely confined to sub-Saharan Africa and the Amazon Basin. Even here, agronomic problems will limit the rate of expansion. When the cost of desalting seawater is substantially reduced-probably not before the late 1970's or early 1980's at best-it may become feasible to irrigate large areas of desert. 4) Given the limited possibilities for expanding the area of land under cultivation, most of the increases in world food needs must be met, for the foreseeable future, by raising the productivity of land already under cultivation. Food output per acre, rather static throughout most of history, has begun to increase rapidly in some of the more advanced countries in recent decades. All of the increases in food production over the past quarter century in North America, western Europe, and Japan have come from increasing the productivity of land already under cultivation. The area under cultivation has actually declined. 5) Achieving dramatic gains in land productivity requires a massive investment of capital and the widespread adoption of new technology. A similar effort must now be made in the less-developed nations if these nations are to feed their people. The most important single factor influencing this rate of investment is food prices, more particularly the relationship between the price farmers receive for their food products and the cost of modern inputs such as fertilizer. 6) In some of the more-developed countries where per-acre yields have been rising for a long time, there is now evidence that the rate of yield increase may be slowing. Nonrecurring inputs may have made their maximum contribution to output in the case of some crops, pushing yield levels past the middle of the S-shaped logistic curve. Although this cannot be determined with any certainty, the possibility that the middle of the curve has been passed in some instances should be taken into account in viewing the long-term future. 7) If the rate of increase in yield per acre does in fact begin to slow in some of the agriculturally advanced countries, additional pressure will be put on the less-developed countries-which have much of the world's unrealized food-production potential-to meet the continuing future increases in world food needs. 8) Man has not yet been able to bypass the process of photosynthesis in the production of food. This dependence on photosynthesis plays a significant role in determining the upper levels of the S-shaped yield curve. Additional research is urgently needed to increase the photosynthetic efficiency of crops and to raise the upper levels of economically feasible yields.<Agriculture, Economics, Europe, Food Supply, Hybridization, Genetic, Japan, Oryza, Photosynthesis, Population Growth, Triticum, United States, Zea mays
16051490<Repair of damaged DNA in a eucaryotic cell: Tetrahymena pyriformis.<Damage induced by ultraviolet light or x-rays to the DNA of a eucaryotic organism, Tetrahymena pyriformis, is repaired by a process similar to the repair system present in bacteria. This repair process, which involves defect excision and subsequent resynthesis of the damaged section of DNA, occurs in the dark. Photoreactivation of damage induced by ultraviolet light is also indicated by a reduction in observed repair synthesis. An improved method for detecting repair synthesis is described. Repair synthesis is measured in parental DNA strands isolated from cultures that have undergone normal DNA replication after the repair process.<Bromodeoxyuridine, Centrifugation, Density Gradient, DNA, analysis, biosynthesis, radiation effects, DNA Replication, Phosphorus Isotopes, Radiation Effects, Tetrahymena, metabolism, radiation effects, Tritium, Ultraviolet Rays
16051491<Photoelectric potential from photoreceptor cells in ventral eye of Limulus.<Intense colored light from a gas laser evokes a photoelectric potential in the photoreceptor cells of the ventral eye of Limulus. This potential has two components, both of which have the action spectrum of a rhodopsin with an absorbancy maximum at 530 nm. The evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that the photoelectric potential arises directly from the orderly array of rhodopsin molecules which are an integral part of the photoreceptor cell membrane.<Animals, Crustacea, Light, Membrane Potentials, Ocular Physiological Phenomena, Retinal Pigments, physiology, Sensory Receptor Cells, physiology

After training by reward and punishment, blinded bullheads were able to discriminate between the odors of two donor fish, but they lost this ability when deprived of their sense of smell. The main source of the intraspecific chemical stimuli involved in recognition is the mucus. A change in status after fighting was chemically communicated to other bullheads.<Animal Communication, Animals, Behavior, Animal, Discrimination Learning, Fishes, Marine Biology, Pheromones, Smell
16051778<Observations on the rhythmic variation in the cat carotid body chemoreceptor activity which has the same period as respiration.<1. The activity in carotid body chemoreceptor afferent fibres in the cat has been recorded and found to have a rhythm with the same period as respiration.2. This rhythm is not an artifact; it is not due to arterial pressure changes with respiration nor to cyclical changes in pulmonary venous admixture. It is caused by changes in blood gas tensions during each respiratory cycle.3. The amplitude of the rhythm is modified by transient and long-term changes in inspired oxygen or CO(2) so that a rise or fall in O(2) or CO(2) tensions of arterial blood (P(a,O2), P(a,CO2)) from the physiological range reduces it. The ratio of the rhythm amplitude to the mean rate of chemoreceptor discharge increases with P(a,O2) over the range 40-240 mm Hg.4. The rhythm is modified by changes in respiratory frequency and volume.5. The fluctuations of arterial oxygen tension which have the same period as respiration are shown to be conducted up the vertebral artery at least as far as the vertebro-occipital anastomosis.6. It is proposed that the chemoreceptor rhythm reflects the moment to moment changes in blood gas tensions.<Action Potentials, Animals, Blood Pressure, Carbon Dioxide, analysis, pharmacology, Carotid Arteries, physiology, Carotid Body, physiology, Cats, Chemoreceptor Cells, physiology, Oxygen, analysis, pharmacology, Respiration, physiology
16051779<Observations on carotid body chemoreceptor activity and cervical sympathetic discharge in the cat.<1. Parallel recordings have been made of the cervical sympathetic and carotid body chemoreceptor activity in the anaesthetized cat.2. The sympathetic activity remains remarkably constant while the chemoreceptor activity is varied by changes in the blood gas tensions of relatively short duration.3. Changes in intrathoracic pressure by obstruction to the airway or thoracic compression were associated with changes in the activity of both nerves.4. It is likely that, under normal conditions, the sympathetic nervous activity provides a stable vasomotor tone within the carotid body.<Action Potentials, Animals, Blood Pressure, Carbon Dioxide, pharmacology, Carotid Body, physiology, Cats, Chemoreceptor Cells, physiology, Oxygen, Respiration, Sympathetic Nervous System, physiology, Vasomotor System, physiology
16051780<Factors affecting the cat carotid chemoreceptor and cervical sympathetic activity with special reference to passive hind-limb movements.<1. Recordings have been made of the activity in carotid body chemoreceptor afferent fibres and in the cervical sympathetic of the cat during passive movement of the hind limbs.2. The chemoreceptor activity increases immediately the limbs are moved and is maintained at a raised level with preservation of the chemoreceptor rhythm fluctuations throughout. In some cases, the increase persists for a time after the movements are stopped.3. This early change does not occur if the cervical sympathetic on the same side as the carotid body from which recordings are made is cut, nor does it occur if the femoral and sciatic nerves are cut.4. The carotid artery oxygen tension (P(a, O2)) increases early; in the majority of experiments, there was no significant change in end-tidal P(CO2) although the minute volume of ventilation (V) increased by about 20% of control with passive movement of the hind limbs.5. Passive movement of the hind limbs also causes an immediate rise in cervical sympathetic activity which is sustained, and which is abolished if the femoral and sciatic nerves are cut.6. Electrical stimulation of the cervical sympathetic causes an increase in chemoreceptor afferent discharge.7. Bilateral cervical sympathectomy causes the respiratory lag to increase from approximately 1 sec to some 20 sec and, when passive movements cease, the fall in V is more sluggish than control.8. These results are discussed in the light of the controversy regarding humoral and neurogenic causes for the increase in respiration in exercise.<Animals, Blood Pressure, Carbon Dioxide, analysis, Carotid Body, physiology, Cats, Chemoreceptor Cells, physiology, Electric Stimulation, Leg, innervation, Movement, physiology, Oxygen, blood, Respiration, physiology, Sympathectomy, Sympathetic Nervous System, physiology
16051781<Carotid body chemoreceptor activity in the new-born lamb.<1. Tidal volume, carotid artery oxygen tension (P(a,O2)) and blood pressure and chemoreceptor activity in the sinus nerve have been continuously measured and recorded in nine lambs anaesthetized with pentobarbitone sodium, and varying in age from some minutes after birth to 5 days after birth.2. Inhalation of 100% oxygen caused, after a delay of 3-4 sec, a rise in P(a,O2), a fall in minute ventilation (V) and chemoreceptor activity. The respiratory response was abolished after section of both sinus nerves.3. Inhalation of 10% oxygen in nitrogen caused a fall in carotid P(a,O2), a rise in respiration and in chemoreceptor activity. The respiratory response was abolished after both sinus nerves had been cut.4. Minute ventilation, carotid P(a,O2) and chemoreceptor activity increased on breathing 5% CO(2) in air. Section of both sinus nerves did not affect the maximum increase in ventilation but the lag of the respiratory response approximately doubled while respiration increased more slowly.5. From these results, it was calculated that the chemoreceptors had a latency of 0.25-0.5 sec and the time constant of the rate of change of chemoreceptor activity was 10-15 sec.6. The chemoreceptors responded to changes in P(a,O2) of +/-5-10 mm Hg.7. Comparison of these results with those reported in adult animals suggest that the peripheral chemoreceptors are fully mature at birth, that their response does not differ with the age of the lamb and that the carotid body chemoreceptors are concerned both in the mediation of the hypoxic drive to ventilation and in the respiratory response to inhaled CO(2).<Action Potentials, Animals, Animals, Newborn, physiology, Blood Pressure, Carbon Dioxide, blood, pharmacology, Carotid Body, physiology, Chemoreceptor Cells, physiology, Oxygen, blood, pharmacology, Respiration, physiology, Sheep
16051782<The effect of cations on the electrical properties of the smooth muscle cells of the guinea-pig vas deferens.<1. A study has been made of the effects of Na(+) and Ca(2+) on the responses generated by intracellular current pulses in smooth muscle cells of the guinea-pig vas deferens and upon the propagated action potential.2. Reduction of the extracellular Na(+) activity (a(Na)) to less than 30 mM did not alter the characteristics of the spike-like response to intracellular current pulses (the active response) or of the propagated action potential.3. Reduction of the extracellular Ca(2+) activity (a(Ca)) to 0.1 mM decreased the resting input resistance of the cells but increased the input resistance during the crest of the active response. Reduction of Ca(2+) decreased the overshoot of the action potential by 22 mV per tenfold change in Ca(2+) and the resting potential by 25 mV per tenfold change.4. Reduction of the extracellular Ca(2+), keeping the product a(Ca)/a(2) (Na) constant, did not change the resting potential, but decreased the action potential overshoot by 20 mV per tenfold change.5. It is suggested that part of the current responsible for the rising phase of the action potential is carried by Ca(2+).<Action Potentials, drug effects, Animals, Calcium, pharmacology, Cell Membrane, drug effects, Guinea Pigs, In Vitro Techniques, Male, Membrane Potentials, drug effects, Muscle Contraction, drug effects, Muscle, Smooth, drug effects, Neuromuscular Junction, drug effects, Sodium, pharmacology, Vas Deferens, drug effects
16051783<Transport and distribution of sodium across frog skin.<1. The time course of (22)Na influx across frog skin mounted as a flat sheet between two lucite chambers has been studied. The flux reaches its maximal steady value in about 30 min.2. The time course of changes in (22)Na specific activity in the cells has been followed by two different methods: (1) periodical measurements of (22)Na activity in pieces of skin mounted in a special device in which the outer facing membrane was in contact with the tracer and (2) measurement of uptake of (24)Na in individual pieces of skin suspended in Ringer solution. Under both circumstances the skin failed to exchange all its Na.3. Considerations on the basis of the kinetics of (22)Na influx and (22)Na specific activity indicate that there exist at least two different Na compartments in the epithelium, one of them being directly involved in Na transport.4. The (22)Na specific activity profile was studied in skins which had previously been mounted as a flat sheet between two chambers with tracer in one of them. This was carried out by removing the skin from the chamber, freezing, slicing and analysing the slices for Na and (22)Na. The results indicate that both Na compartments are distributed across the whole epithelium.5. The results of these studies are taken to indicate: (a) that the Na partition in the tissue is not a result of the Na being contained in different cellular layers; (b) that Na transport across frog skin is carried out by all the epithelial cells and is not restricted to those of a particular layer; (c) that Na entry from an outer solution containing from 1 to 10 mM-Na occurs into the transporting cells down an electrochemical potential gradient and therefore need not involve an active mechanism at the outer border of the cells.<Animals, Anura, Biological Transport, Active, Epithelium, metabolism, Female, In Vitro Techniques, Male, Skin, analysis, metabolism, Sodium, analysis, metabolism
16051784<Resting and spike potentials of skeletal muscle fibres of salt-water elasmobranch and teleost fish.<1. Membrane properties of the muscle fibre were studied in twitch motor system of sea-water elasmobranch (Taeniura lymma, Himantura uarnak and Pastinachus sephen) and teleost fish (Periophthalmodon barbarus, Tetradon immaculata, Hemiramphus welsby, Parexocoetus brachypterus and Conger labiatus).2. The resting potential of the elasmobranch fibre is mainly determined by the Cl(-) concentration difference between inside and outside the membrane whereas the K(+) conductance is the determining factor in teleost fibres.3. The resting membrane of the elasmobranch fibre is permeable not only to Cl(-) ions but also several other anions (Br(-), I(-), NO(3) (-), SCN(-), ClO(4) (-), ClO(3) (-)) of large limiting conductivities in the aqueous solution.4. The spike potential of the elasmobranch fibre always shows a significant overshoot in normal saline while no significant overshoot is generally found in teleost fibres.5. In both elasmobranchs and teleosts the spike is produced by the permeability increase of the membrane to Na(+) ions and is effectively suppressed by tetrodotoxin at a concentration of 0.5-1.0 x 10(-7) g/ml. of the external solution with one exception, i.e. the Na(+) spike of Tetradon fibre is not suppressed by the toxin even when the concentration is above 5 x 10(-4) g/ml.<Animals, Cell Membrane, physiology, Cell Membrane Permeability, Chlorides, pharmacology, Electrophysiology, Fishes, In Vitro Techniques, Membrane Potentials, Muscle Contraction, drug effects, Muscles, physiology, Myofibrils, physiology, Neuromuscular Junction, physiology, Potassium, pharmacology, Sodium Chloride, pharmacology
16051785<Active transport of ions by the gastric mucosa of the rabbit foetus.<1. The short-circuit current and absolute fluxes of Na(+) and Cl(-) across the gastric mucosa of the 28-day rabbit foetus have been measured in vitro.2. Substitution of Na(+) in the solution bathing the mucosal surface by choline ion or K(+) resulted in a 70% decrease in short-circuit current which was reversed when Na(+) was restored to the mucosal solution. The portion of the short-circuit current dependent on the presence of Na(+) in the mucosal solution was found to be equivalent to the net flux of Na(+) from mucosa to serosa.3. The net flux of Cl(-) from serosa to mucosa was compared with the short-circuit current persisting when Na(+) had been replaced in the mucosal solution. Averaged results from sixteen experiments indicated that the net flux of Cl(-) was equivalent to 166% of the Na(+) independent short-circuit current.4. The results indicated that the component of short-circuit current associated with acid secretion was independent of the presence of Na(+) in the mucosal solution.5. The small scale of the experiments and the secretion of mucus by the preparation did not permit successful simultaneous measurement of H(+) secretion and short-circuit current.6. Replacement of Cl(-) by SO(4) (2-) or glucuronate in the solutions on both sides did not result in a reversal or decrease in magnitude of the Na(+) independent short-circuit current, even after allowing time for the tissue to become depleted of Cl(-). It is suggested that a non-specific active anion transport was occurring.<Animals, Biological Transport, Active, Cell Membrane, physiology, Chlorides, Electrophysiology, Fetus, Gastric Mucosa, physiology, In Vitro Techniques, Rabbits, Sodium
16051786<Myelinated afferent fibres responding specifically to noxious stimulation of the skin.<1. The characteristics of receptors from the hairy skin of the hind limb of cat were studied by recording from single primary afferent fibres with fine micropipettes. The distinctive features of 513 fibres conducting under 51 m/sec are described.2. Seventy-four fibres conducting between 6 and 37 m/sec were classified as nociceptors because they responded only to damaging mechanical stimulation of the skin. These fibres responded maximally to pinching the skin with a serrated forceps or to cutting the skin. Noxious heat, noxious cold, acid applied to the receptive field and bradykinin injected into skin cuts did not evoke discharges from such receptors. Typically their receptive fields were 2-5 cm long by 1-2.5 cm wide and consisted of responsive spots (under 1 mm diameter) separated by unresponsive areas. There was a tendency for the most slowly conducting fibres so classified to be the least sensitive.3. Other afferent fibres had receptive fields similar to the nociceptors; however, they were excited by substantial but not noxious mechanical deformation. Their conduction velocities overlapped those of the nociceptors and extended upwards to 51 m/sec; the most rapidly conducting fibres tended to be the most sensitive to mechanical stimuli. These insensitive mechanoreceptors or moderate pressure receptors adapted more slowly than the nociceptors.4. The majority of fine myelinated axons originated from hair receptors and had conduction velocities concentrated between 14 and 22 m/sec.5. The possible relation of these observations to pain and reactions typical of pain is considered.<Action Potentials, physiology, Animals, Axons, physiology, Cats, Electric Stimulation, Hair, Myelin Sheath, physiology, Neural Conduction, physiology, Sensory Receptor Cells, physiology, Skin, innervation
16051787<The inhibitory action of monoamines on lateral geniculate neurones.<1. L-Noradrenaline (NA), dopamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and lysergide were administered iontophoretically to neurones in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of the cat and the responses to these drugs recorded.2. Many neurones were depressed by the monoamines and lysergide.3. This depression was manifested by a reduction or abolition of the effects of optic nerve or visual stimulation, by a failure in some instances of an antidromically propagating spike to invade the cell soma, and by a depression of the excitant effects of L-glutamate and acetylcholine.4. Although there was considerable variation in the magnitude of the depressant effects of the monoamines, dopamine was found to be slightly more potent than 5-HT and NA. Neurones which were inhibited by catecholamines did not always respond to 5-HT and lysergide and vice versa.5. The inhibitory actions of monoamines on lateral geniculate neurones are comparable with those that have been recorded in other structures of the central nervous system.6. Lysergide did not antagonize the action of 5-HT.7. Catecholamines and 5-HT are present in nerve terminals in the lateral geniculate nucleus and the findings of this study suggest that they act as inhibitory transmitters.<Acetylcholine, pharmacology, Animals, Cats, Dopamine, pharmacology, Evoked Potentials, physiology, Geniculate Bodies, drug effects, Glutamates, pharmacology, Histocytochemistry, Iontophoresis, Lysergic Acid Diethylamide, pharmacology, Neurons, Norepinephrine, pharmacology, Optic Nerve, physiology, Serotonin, pharmacology, Sympathomimetics, pharmacology
16051788<Visual resolution when light enters the eye through different parts of the pupil.<1. Threshold contrasts for resolution of sinusoidal gratings imaged on to the retina through a decentred 2 mm pupil were measured.2. No loss in resolution was found when the pupil was decentred parallel to the lines of the gratings. A loss in resolution by a factor of 3 occurred when the pupil was decentred by 3 mm perpendicular to the lines of the gratings.3. The effects of focus on the threshold contrast for a grating viewed through a centred and decentred pupil were used to show that at least a portion of the loss in resolution is due to optical aberrations.4. Using a neon-helium gas laser as a coherent light source, interference fringes were produced on the retina directly. Threshold contrasts for resolution of the fringes were determined for different positions of entry of the beams of light through the pupil. When the Stiles-Crawford brightness effect was compensated for, no loss in resolution was found to occur for decentred entry of the beams.5. It is concluded that the off-axis loss of visual acuity is wholly due to optical aberrations in the eye.6. The ratios between the threshold contrasts for sinusoidal gratings and for interference fringes are used to calculate the optical transfer functions of the off-axis aberrations of the eye.<Humans, Lasers, Optics and Photonics, Pupil, physiology, Retina, physiology, Vision, Ocular, physiology
16051789<The metabolic response of brain slices to agents affecting the sodium pump.<1. Slices of brain cortex from rabbits were incubated in Ringer solution and in Ringer modified by the removal of calcium and sodium, and the addition of ouabain, oligomycin or extra potassium. The potassium content of the tissue, the oxygen consumption and the lactate production from glucose were measured and found to be interrelated.2. Incubation in high-K Ringer caused an increase in oxygen consumption that was prevented by ouabain, oligomycin and deprivation of sodium. Lactate production was also raised, but this increase was unaffected by ouabain and raised further by oligomycin.3. Calcium omission raised metabolism; the tissue K content was unaffected. Oligomycin always decreased oxygen consumption and raised lactate production further. The metabolic responses to calcium, potassium, ouabain and oligomycin depended on sodium.4. After anaerobic incubation, the tissue potassium concentration was still 5 times higher than that in Ringer. It was unaffected by oligomycin but lowered markedly by ouabain.5. The synergistic effects of sodium with potassium, oligomycin, calcium, and calcium plus ouabain suggest that the metabolic responses of brain cortex slices to a high-K Ringer depend on the operation of the sodium pump.<Animals, Biological Transport, Active, Calcium, pharmacology, Cell Membrane Permeability, Cerebral Cortex, analysis, metabolism, Drug Synergism, In Vitro Techniques, Lactates, analysis, biosynthesis, Oligomycins, pharmacology, Ouabain, pharmacology, Oxygen Consumption, Potassium, analysis, Rabbits, Sodium, physiology
16051790<The synaptic basis of a bilateral lingual-hypoglossal reflex in cats.<1. Reflex discharge of some hypoglossal neurones innervating the intrinsic musculature of the tongue occurred following single stimuli delivered to low threshold afferents in the ipsilateral or contralateral lingual nerves of decerebrate cats.2. The discharge produced by contralateral lingual nerve stimuli was smaller and had a longer latency than that produced by ipsilateral lingual nerve stimuli. The timing of the ipsilateral response suggested that two synapses were included in the reflex arc.3. Intracellular recordings in hypoglossal motoneurones revealed complex depolarizing and later hyperpolarizing synaptic respones following single nerve stimuli. The direction of the early synaptic action in any cell was the same whether low threshold afferents in the ipsilateral or the contralateral lingual nerve were stimulated. The timing of these synaptic responses and the occurrence of ripples on the rising phase of many of the depolarizing potentials was consistent with the presence of an internuncial neurone in the pathway from the afferent fibres to the motoneurone.4. Recordings were made of the discharges of neurones in or near the sensory nucleus of the spinal trigeminal tract caused by lingual nerve stimuli. The latencies of these discharges and the characters of the bursts of responses which followed single lingual nerve stimuli indicated that these neurones could be the internuncials on the reflex pathway.5.

16051791<Site of origin of the abnormal discharge in the electrocorticogram produced by tubocurarine perfused through the anterior horn of a lateral ventricle.<1. In cats anaesthetized with chloralose, perfusion of tubocurarine through the anterior horn of a lateral cerebral ventricle produces a rhythmic discharge of high voltage negative spikes recorded from an electrode inserted into this horn. The discharge spreads to the cerebral cortex where it gives rise to synchronous surface negative deflexions of low voltage. They have previously been described as ;slow waves'.2. The discharge results from an excitatory action of tubocurarine on the anterior limbic area, which is a cortical structure in the medial wall of the anterior horn lying rostral to the septum pellucidum.<Animals, Cats, Caudate Nucleus, drug effects, Cerebral Ventricles, drug effects, Electroencephalography, Limbic System, drug effects, Perfusion, Tubocurarine, pharmacology
16051792<Spike propagation in the smooth muscle of the guinea-pig taenia coli.<1. Spike activity was produced by external field stimulation of the guinea-pig taenia coli. Spikes were evoked by depolarization of the muscle membrane. Though the activity was usually also observed during hyperpolarization, this was shown to be conducted activity from the depolarized region of the tissue. Spike conduction was blocked when hyperpolarization exceeded 10 mV.2. The shape of the conducted spike was influenced by membrane polarization. Sometimes a notch appeared on the spike and sometimes the spike was split into two by hyperpolarization. This is probably due to the fact that functional bundles form a network and that the branches between bundles are more susceptible to the membrane polarization.3. There was a critical spike amplitude for normal propagation. Therefore, different spike amplitudes were observed near the stimulating electrode, but only spikes of nearly full size amplitude were recorded far from the stimulating electrode, i.e. at a distance of more than 5 mm.4. When repetitive stimulation was applied, the spike amplitude decreased with increasing frequency of stimulation. No steady level was reached, however, but the spike amplitude fluctuated at about 0.3 c/s.<Animals, Electric Stimulation, Electrophysiology, Evoked Potentials, Guinea Pigs, Hypertonic Solutions, Intestine, Large, physiology, Membrane Potentials, Muscle, Smooth, physiology, Tetrodotoxin, pharmacology
16051793<An afferent pathway for the selective release of vasopressin in response to carotid occlusion and haemorrhage in the cat.<1. The release of neurohypophysial hormones in response to carotid occlusion and haemorrhage has been studied in anaesthetized cats. Samples of jugular venous blood were extracted with alcohol and the extracts assayed for antidiuretic and milk-ejecting activity.2. The release of vasopressin in response to bilateral occlusion of the common carotid arteries has been confirmed in the cat; this effect was abolished when the sinus nerves were divided.3. Using a new sensitive preparation for the assay of milk-ejecting activity in blood extracts, it has been shown that no oxytocin accompanies the release of vasopressin during carotid occlusion.4. The independent release of vasopressin without oxytocin during haemorrhage has also been confirmed, and the role of the sinus nerves and vagi in this response investigated. Bilateral division of either nerve reduced the response, but the vagus appeared to be of greater importance than the sinus nerve.5. A reflex arc for the selective release of vasopressin has been proposed, of which the fibres of the sinus nerves and vagi form the afferent component and the neurones of the supraoptic nucleus the efferent component.<Animals, Carotid Arteries, Carotid Body, innervation, Carotid Sinus, innervation, Cats, Female, Hemorrhage, Oxytocin, metabolism, Pressoreceptors, physiology, Rats, Reflex, physiology, Sympathectomy, Vagotomy, Vagus Nerve, physiology, Vasopressins, metabolism
16051794<Anion permeability of the inhibitory post-synaptic membrane of the crayfish neuromuscular junction.<1. The membrane conductance of the crayfish muscle fibre was calculated and the increase in the membrane conductance brought about by the application of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was investigated under various conditions. The permeability of the activated inhibitory post-synaptic membrane was estimated from the conductance change.2. When the concentration of Cl(-) was changed by substituting Cl(-) with methylsulphate, a linear relation was obtained between the membrane conductance change produced by GABA and the concentration of Cl(-). Cations have no appreciable effect on the GABA induced conductance change (less than 0.4%).3. The conductance change produced by GABA on the inhibitory post-synaptic membrane was measured in various solutions in which the Cl(-) was replaced by various anions. The degree of permeability depended on the anion species in the following order:Br(-) &gt; Cl(-) &gt; SCN(-) &gt; I(-) &gt; NO(3) (-) &gt; HCOO(-) &gt; ClO(3) (-) &gt; ClO(4) (-) &gt; BrO(3) (-)4. At high pH the conductance change produced by GABA was decreased, while at low pH it increased.5. These results show that the activated inhibitory post-synaptic membrane of crayfish muscle fibres has the characteristics of an anion selective membrane, suggesting the fixed positive charges in the inhibitory membrane.<Aminobutyrates, pharmacology, Animals, Cats, Cell Membrane Permeability, drug effects, physiology, Crustacea, Membrane Potentials, drug effects, Neuromuscular Junction, drug effects, physiology
16051795<Intracellular enzymes in local lymph as a measure of cellular injury.<1. Lymph was collected directly from the hind limb of cats anaesthetized with pentobarbitone before and for several hours after the limb was injured.2. After the limb was subjected to very mild injury such as hot water at 50 degrees C or ischaemia for 1 hr there was no increase in protein or enzyme concentrations in the lymph, although after the ischaemia there was an increase in lymph flow.3. After burning the limb at 60 degrees C there was a significant increase in the concentrations of the cytoplasmic enzymes glutamic-oxalacetic transaminase and lactic dehydrogenase, as a result of an increased permeability of the cell membrane.4. When the limb was burned at 80 degrees C there was a marked increase not only in the cytoplasmic enzymes but also in the mitochondrial enzyme glutamic pyruvic transaminase. Thus with the stronger burn the permeability of the intracellular mitochondrial membrane was also increased.5. Not until the most severe injury of all, i.e. freezing the limb solid, was there an increase in the concentration of lysosomal enzymes in the lymph.6. It is concluded that estimation of intracellular enzymes in the lymph draining an injured tissue affords a method of assessing the extent of cellular injury.<Acid Phosphatase, analysis, Animals, Burns, enzymology, Cats, Cell Membrane Permeability, Freezing, Glucuronidase, analysis, Ischemia, enzymology, L-Lactate Dehydrogenase, analysis, Lymph, enzymology, Potassium, analysis, Proteins, analysis, Transaminases, analysis, Wounds and Injuries, enzymology
16051796<Potassium transport and nucleoside metabolism in human red cells.<1. A study has been made of active cation transport in relation to the metabolism of nucleosides and deoxynucleosides in human red blood cells.2. Lactate production from inosine depended on the cellular inorganic phosphate available for phosphorolysis and was raised to some 4 times the normal rate from glucose. Inosine inhibited glucose metabolism according to the amount of glucose-6-phosphate produced. Guanosine behaved similarly, but glucose-6-phosphate was not formed from adenosine, deoxyinosine and deoxyguanosine.3. Glucose metabolism was related to the ATP content of the cells, which was raised by incubation with adenosine, or with inosine plus adenine.4. Adenosine and deoxyadenosine raised the potassium influx above the values found with inosine and deoxyinosine under conditions when the lactate production was constant. Active potassium influx was correlated with the ATP concentration in the cells, but independent of the lactate production when the latter was raised above normal.<Adenosine Triphosphate, analysis, biosynthesis, Biological Transport, Active, Erythrocytes, metabolism, Glucose, metabolism, Humans, Lactates, biosynthesis, Male, Nucleosides, metabolism, Potassium, metabolism

16051798<The variation of hand tremor with force in healthy subjects.<1. Total root-mean-square (r.m.s.) error over an effectively unrestricted band, and error power spectra from 0.256 to 12.5 c/s were measured for four subjects attempting to maintain fixed forces of 1-6 Lb. (0.45-2.72 kg) on a pressure joystick. The subject could see his errors as the deflexion of a cathode ray tube spot.2. The total r.m.s. error increases linearly with force with a considerable (positive) intercept when the line is extrapolated to zero force. Hence accuracy in the sense (r.m.s. error)/(force) increases with force for this type of control.3. The rate of increase of total r.m.s. error with force is greater in subjects with prominent tremor peaks in their power spectra at 8-10 c/s.4. At each frequency the r.m.s. error per unit bandwidth also increases linearly with force. Except at the very lowest frequencies the rate of increase is greater in subjects with prominent tremor peaks at 8-10 c/s. This is thought to account for the observation described in paragraph 3.5. The frequency of the tremor peak near 8-10 c/s is almost independent of the force exerted.<Feedback, Hand, Humans, Muscles, physiology, Physical Exertion, physiology, Vision, Ocular, physiology
16051799<The relation between neural and perceptual intensity: a comparative study on the neural and psychophysical response to taste stimuli.<1. Recording the summated electrical response from the human chorda tympani in the middle ear provides data for a quantitative study of the relation between the neural activity and the strength of the stimulus applied to the tongue which can be compared with the relation between the subjective estimation and the stimulus strength.2. Full comparative data obtained from two patients showed a very high correlation between the functions describing the subjective and the neural response in relation to the strength of citric acid and sucrose solutions applied to the tongue. In a third patient the same high correlation was obtained for NaCl and citric acid.3. The good agreement between the individual neurophysiological experiments and the psychophysical group experiment favours the view that a fundamental congruity is found between neural activity and perceptual intensity.<Chorda Tympani Nerve, physiology, Citrates, Humans, Neurophysiology, Psychophysiology, Sucrose, Taste, Tongue, physiology

The in vitro calcium content of the smooth muscle of the guinea-pig taenia coli was 3.0 m-mole Ca/kg wet wt. when phosphate was omitted from the bathing medium, and was almost independent of pH changes in the range 6.7-7.6.2. The calcium content was not changed when 1 mM phosphate was included in the medium, if the pH was 6.7 or 7.0. However, when the pH was 7.6, the calcium content increased by 1.5 m-mole Ca/kg wet wt. in the presence of phosphate.3. The calcium content rose by 1.1 m-mole Ca/kg wet wt. when NaCl in the bathing medium was replaced by isotonic sucrose, and rose by 0.7 m-mole Ca/kg wet wt. when MgCl(2) in the bathing medium was replaced. These increases may reflect a competition between Ca(2+) and other cations for fixed negative sites in the tissue.4. The initial rapid phase of (42)K exchange corresponded to an ;extra-cellular (42)K-space' of 470 ml./kg fresh wt. in normal solution, rising to 560 ml./kg. fresh wt. in low-sodium solution and to 760 ml./kg fresh wt. in calcium-free low-sodium solution. In this last medium the extra-cellular [(14)C]sorbitol space was only 390 ml./kg fresh wt., so that there was a large excess of rapidly-exchanging potassium which may have been competing at fixed negative sites.<Animals, Biological Transport, physiology, Calcium, analysis, Colon, analysis, Guinea Pigs, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, In Vitro Techniques, Magnesium, pharmacology, Muscle, Smooth, analysis, Potassium, metabolism, Sodium, pharmacology
16051801<The behaviour of the sodium pump in red cells in the absence of external potassium.<1. When red cells loaded with (24)Na are incubated in balanced glucose salt solutions, the removal of external potassium reduces sodium efflux by about one third. Ouabain reduces the residual sodium efflux by about one half.2. The ouabain-sensitive efflux of sodium into potassium-free solutions is accompanied by an equal ouabain-sensitive influx of sodium.3. If sodium in the external potassium-free salt solution is progressively replaced with choline, both the ouabain-sensitive sodium efflux and the ouabain-sensitive sodium influx are reduced until, with only 5 mM-Na externally, both become very small.4. At sodium concentrations intermediate between 140 mM and 5 mM, ouabain-sensitive sodium influx and ouabain-sensitive sodium efflux remain equal within the limits of experimental error. The relation between the magnitude of the ouabain-sensitive sodium exchange and the external sodium concentration is roughly linear.5. As the external sodium concentration is decreased beyond 5 mM towards zero, ouabain-sensitive sodium efflux increases again.6. In the presence of 5 mM-K, the ouabain-sensitive sodium efflux is scarcely affected by replacing most of the external sodium with choline.7. In the presence of ouabain, sodium efflux is unaffected by external potassium and is little affected by replacing external sodium with choline.8. The results suggest that in the absence of external potassium the ouabain-sensitive transport mechanism catalyses a one-for-one exchange of sodium ions across the cell membrane. The relation between this exchange and Ussing's classical ;exchange diffusion' is discussed.9. The exchange does not occur in the presence of external potassium at physiological concentrations.10. Calculations of sodium efflux were based on the specific activities of total cell sodium: separate experiments confirmed that these were the same as the specific activities of sodium lost to sodium-free solutions. No evidence of a slowly exchanging sodium fraction was found.<Biological Transport, Active, Calcium, pharmacology, Cell Membrane, physiology, Cell Membrane Permeability, Erythrocytes, physiology, Magnesium, pharmacology, Ouabain, pharmacology, Potassium, pharmacology, Sodium, pharmacology
16051802<The sensitivity of the sodium pump to external sodium.<1. When red cells are incubated in potassium-free solutions, ouabain-sensitive sodium efflux is nearly absent with 5 mM-Na externally, but increases as the external sodium concentration is reduced from 5 mM to zero. This increase suggests that the transport mechanism is very sensitive to small amounts of sodium at the outside surface of the cell membrane. Further evidence for such sensitivity has been obtained from the effects of external sodium on the relation between potassium influx and external potassium concentration.2. With 5 mM-[K](o), potassium influx is rather insensitive to [Na](o) but at low potassium concentrations even low levels of sodium inhibit.3. With 140 mM-[Na](o) the potassium influx curve is S-shaped below 1 mM [K](o). At much lower sodium concentrations, the S-shaped region and the value of [K](o) for which potassium influx is half-maximal are both shifted progressively towards zero. At 10 muM-[Na](o), potassium influx is half maximal at 0.14 mM-[K](o) and the curve is close to a rectangular hyperbola down to 22 muM-[K](o); there seems to be a trace of inflexion at about 15 muM-[K](o).4. When [Na](o) is reduced from 5 mM to zero, removal of the inhibitory effect of external sodium ions on sodium: potassium exchange could lead to an increase in sodium efflux into nominally potassium-free solutions if these solutions did in fact contain traces of potassium. Such traces could arise by leakage from the cells, but, in a number of experiments, direct measurements showed that [K](o) was too low to account in this way for all of the observed ouabain-sensitive sodium efflux. A further reason for rejecting this explanation is that ouabain-sensitive potassium loss into nominally (Na+K)-free solutions was unaffected by adding 5 mM-Na. (A slight increase in ouabain-resistant loss was observed.)5. The ouabain-sensitive efflux of sodium into (Na+K)-free solutions therefore seems to represent a mode of behaviour of the transport mechanism distinct both from the sodium: potassium exchange that occurs under physiological conditions and from the sodium: sodium exchange that occurs in K-free, Na-rich media.<Biological Transport, Cell Membrane, physiology, Cell Membrane Permeability, Erythrocytes, physiology, Ouabain, pharmacology, Potassium, pharmacology, Sodium, pharmacology
16051803<Facftors affecting the relative magnitudes of the sodium:potassium and sodium:sodium exchanges catalysed by the sodium pump.<1. The effects of external potassium on sodium: potassium exchange and sodium: sodium exchange in human red cells have been estimated from measurements of ouabain-sensitive potassium influx and ouabain-sensitive sodium influx in media containing different concentrations of potassium.2. As the external potassium concentration is increased from zero to 5 mM, sodium:sodium exchange-as judged by ouabain-sensitive sodium influx-is progressively suppressed, and sodium:potassium exchange-as judged by ouabain-sensitive potassium influx-is progressively increased. Both exchanges are half-maximal between 1 and 2 mM-K, and at 5 mM-K sodium: sodium exchange becomes very small as sodium: potassium exchange approaches a maximum.3. Experiments have been carried out, mainly on resealed ghosts, to determine what factors affect the magnitude of the sodium:sodium exchange in potassium-free solutions.4. Sodium:sodium exchange does not occur in the absence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP).5. Ghosts containing high concentrations of sodium, no potassium and high concentrations of ATP show no ouabain-sensitive loss of sodium into potassium-free solutions. The ability to carry out sodium:sodium exchange can be restored by replacing most of the internal sodium with potassium or by preparing the cells so that they contain much more orthophosphate (P(i)) than ATP.6. Ghosts containing sodium in low concentration, potassium in high concentration and with a low [ATP]/([ADP].[P(i)]) ratio show a greater ouabain-sensitive loss of sodium into potassium-free media than into media containing potassium; i.e. external potassium reduces ouabain-sensitive sodium efflux.7. The effect of P(i) is not the result of competitive inhibition of the transport ATPase since P(i) at the concentrations used does not inhibit ATPase activity in fragmented ghosts.<Adenine Nucleotides, pharmacology, Adenosine Triphosphate, pharmacology, Biological Transport, Cell Membrane, physiology, Cell Membrane Permeability, Erythrocytes, physiology, Humans, Ouabain, pharmacology, Phosphoric Acids, pharmacology, Potassium, pharmacology, Sodium, pharmacology
16051804<Hypothalamic control of thyrotrophin secretion.<1. By means of the haemagglutination-inhibition technique, it has been possible to measure the plasma and pituitary levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) following unilateral and bilateral electrolytic lesions placed in the supraoptic area of the hypothalamus of female rats.2. Unilateral lesions after 8 and 48 hr caused a temporary decrease in the percentage of circulating TSH followed by a return to normal.3. Bilateral lesions caused a fall in plasma TSH to a level 41% below normal at 10 days whereas the pituitary level increased 70%.4. Rats with bilateral symmetrical supraoptic lesions, kept for 3 days at 4 degrees C, had a lower plasma TSH content (23%) and a higher pituitary TSH content (16%) than the sham operated control animals but the levels of pituitary TSH did not show any significant difference (0.100 &gt; P &gt; 0.050).5. Thyroidectomized rats with bilateral lesions kept at 26 degrees C for 3 days had a much lower plasma TSH (39%) and a slightly higher pituitary TSH as compared to the normal intact animals, suggesting that the hypothalamus also influences the synthesis of TSH in the pituitary.6. Thyroidectomized rats with bilateral lesions kept at 4 degrees C for 3 days showed both a plasma and pituitary TSH increase compared to controls at 26 degrees C, suggesting that when a higher demand for thyroid function is present the pituitary gland has some autonomy for both secretion and release of TSH. This autonomy appears to be slight, as there was no statistically significant difference between the pituitary TSH levels of the thyroidectomized animals bearing similar supraoptic lesions and exposed to 4 and 26 degrees C.<Adjuvants, Immunologic, Animals, Antigen-Antibody Reactions, Female, Hemagglutination Inhibition Tests, Hypothalamus, physiology, Pituitary Gland, analysis, Rats, Thyroid Gland, physiology, Thyrotropin, blood, metabolism
16051805<The effects of stimulation of the hepatic nerves, infusions of noradrenaline and occlusion of the carotid arteries on liver blood flow in the anaesthetized cat.<1. In anaesthetized cats, the hepatic artery, portal vein and inferior vena cava pressures and the hepatic artery and portal vein flows were recorded using pressure transducers and electro-magnetic flowmeters.2. The hepatic nerves were stimulated with maximal stimuli for periods of 2-5 min. The magnitude of the response varied with the frequency of stimulation over the range 1-10 impulses/sec. The resistance to flow increased in both the hepatic artery and the portal vein.3. In the hepatic artery, mean pressure remained virtually constant, while the flow showed an initial marked decrease followed by a return towards the control level. In the portal vein, the flow remained constant while portal pressure showed a maintained increase. These responses were unaffected by previous administration of atropine and propranolol, but were blocked by phenoxybenzamine.4. Infusions of noradrenaline into the hepatic artery produced changes similar to those following stimulation of the nerves. In contrast, when the hepatic arterial pressure was maintained constant, intravenous infusions of noradrenaline produced a maintained decrease in hepatic artery flow.5. The occurrence of autoregulation of the hepatic artery flow at arterial pressures above 80-100 mm Hg was confirmed.6. Occlusion of the carotid arteries caused a rise in arterial pressure with little change in hepatic artery flow, but when the hepatic artery pressure was maintained at the pre-occlusion level the flow showed an abrupt decrease, usually followed by a recovery towards the control level. This decrease was abolished by section of the hepatic nerves and removal of the adrenal glands.7. It is concluded that the increase in hepatic artery resistance during occlusion of the carotid arteries was dependent on the hepatic nerves, the adrenal medullary secretions and an intrinsic autoregulatory mechanism.<Animals, Atropine, pharmacology, Autonomic Nervous System, drug effects, Blood Pressure, Carotid Arteries, physiology, Cats, Hepatic Artery, physiology, Liver, blood supply, innervation, Norepinephrine, pharmacology, Pentobarbital, pharmacology, Phenoxybenzamine, pharmacology, Portal Vein, physiology, Propranolol, pharmacology, Regional Blood Flow, physiology, Splanchnic Nerves, physiology, Vascular Resistance
16051806<The effect of oxytocin and adrenaline on blood flow in the hind limb of the dog following chronic lumbar sympathectomy.<1. In a number of dogs the last two lumbar ganglia were removed unilaterally. At various dates up to the 56th day after operation the dogs were anaesthetized and the effect of oxytocin and adrenaline on hind-leg blood flow studied. Oxytocin alone reduced leg flow in all dogs after operation.2. Until approximately day 11 after operation oxytocin given during an infusion of adrenaline increased leg blood flow, as it does in normal dogs not given adrenaline infusion. After that date it reduced the flow even during adrenaline infusion. The timing of this change suggests that the normal response to adrenaline depends on the presence of undegenerated nerve fibres.3. In one animal the sympathetic nerves were crushed between the last two lumbar ganglia and beyond the last, and hind-leg blood flow frequently measured by means of venous occlusion plethysmography until day 204, when the animal was anaesthetized and acute observations made. Electrical stimulation of the sympathetic chain above the site of crushing caused a reduction in leg flow, indicating that at least some of the nerve supply had regenerated. However, oxytocin reduced leg flow when used alone and exerted no apparent effect in the presence of adrenaline.4. It is suggested that sympathetic nerves to vascular smooth muscle have a function or functions other than transmitter release and that when crushed nerves regenerate the functions do not recover at the same rate.<Animals, Blood Vessels, innervation, Dogs, Epinephrine, pharmacology, Female, Leg, blood supply, innervation, Male, Oxytocin, pharmacology, Regional Blood Flow, drug effects, Sympathectomy, Sympathetic Nervous System, physiology, Vasomotor System, drug effects
16051807<Effects of gestation and prenatal asphyxia on pulmonary surface properties of the foetal rabbit.<1. The pulmonary surface properties of foetal rabbits were studied after delivery by Caesarean section at 26-30 days and after normal delivery at term (31 days).2. Quasi-static pressure-volume curves were defined for the lungs and the surface properties of the same lungs were further studied both by the bubble-stability method and by means of a surface balance and trough. Results given by each method are compared and discussed.3. At the 26th day of gestation the pulmonary surface properties, characteristic of the animal at term, were not yet present. These properties were first evident on the 28th day.4. A period of 16 min intense prenatal asphyxia on the 28th day of gestation failed to produce a change in pulmonary surface properties.<Animals, Asphyxia, Carbon Dioxide, blood, Female, Fetus, physiology, Lung, analysis, physiology, Oxygen, blood, Pregnancy, Pregnancy, Animal, Rabbits, Surface Tension, Surface-Active Agents, analysis
16051808<The distribution of acetylcholine in normal and in regenerating nerves.<1. The distribution of acetylcholine (ACh) in various nerves which had been regenerating for different periods after crushing has been compared with that in uncrushed nerves.2. Normal ventral roots from cats contained 78.1 +/- 22.7 (S.D.) mumole ACh/kg (blotted wet wt.); rabbit ventral roots contained 48.0 mumole/kg +/- 19.0 (S.D.) and rabbit sciatic nerves 16.6 +/- 7.3 (S.D.) mumole/kg. In the sciatic nerves the distal cm of 5 cm lengths taken from the thigh contained 30% more ACh than the most central cm portion. Possible explanations for this difference have been discussed.3. After both sciatic nerves and ventral roots had been crushed, there was an initial build-up (4 times control) of ACh central to the lesion and a decline ((1/4) control) distal to the lesion. These changes were maximum around 5 days after crushing. In sciatic nerves in which long periods of regeneration were investigated, the central build-up fell off to 1(1/2) times control by 25 days and the distal decline reversed to 2 times control in about 10 days. It then again decreased towards the control level by 25 days after crushing. These changes have been discussed in relation to the morphological changes which occur in a nerve following crushing.4. A peak of ACh content moved distally along the nerve from the crushed region at a rate of 1.0-1.5 mm/day. This was considered to represent an average rate of regeneration of the bulk of the axons. The amplitude of the peak declined progressively with time in the more distal parts of the nerve, probably because of dispersion as axons regenerated at different rates.<Acetylcholine, analysis, Animals, Cats, Lumbosacral Plexus, analysis, surgery, Nerve Crush, Nerve Degeneration, analysis, Nerve Regeneration, analysis, Rabbits, Sciatic Nerve, analysis
16051809<Pulmonary vasoconstriction and changes in heart rate during asphyxia in immature foetal lambs.<1. The effect of changing the composition of pulmonary arterial blood on the pulmonary vasoconstrictor response to asphyxia was studied in immature foetal lambs of approximately 90 days gestation age.2. When normal foetal carotid arterial blood (withdrawn before asphyxia) was introduced during asphyxia, the pulmonary vasoconstriction was rapidly and wholly relieved as soon as this blood reached the lung. This did not happen when blood was used which had been withdrawn during asphyxia.3. Conversely introduction into a pulmonary artery of a foetal lamb during recovery, of arterial blood withdrawn during asphyxia, caused an immediate return of pulmonary vasoconstriction.4. These phenomena could not be explained by the generation of vasodilator agents such as bradykinin, acetylcholine, histamine or isoprenaline.5. During asphyxia injection of normal foetal arterial blood into the left atrium did not cause pulmonary vasodilatation, but did elicit a large increase in heart rate.6. Neither the pulmonary vasoconstriction during asphyxia, nor its relief by normal foetal arterial blood, nor the changes in heart rate were affected by previous bilateral vagotomy or administration of atropine or hexamethonium.7. It was concluded that, in immature foetal lambs, the effect of asphyxia in causing pulmonary vasoconstriction was mainly, if not exclusively, by a local action within the lungs, and that the bradycardia during asphyxia was mainly due to the fall in P(O2) acting locally upon the heart.<Acetylcholine, pharmacology, Animals, Asphyxia, physiopathology, Blood Physiological Phenomena, Bradykinin, pharmacology, Carbon Dioxide, blood, Electric Stimulation, Fetus, physiology, Heart Rate, physiology, Histamine, pharmacology, Isoproterenol, pharmacology, Lung, blood supply, Oxygen, blood, Pulmonary Artery, drug effects, physiology, Pulmonary Circulation, Regional Blood Flow, Sheep, Sympathetic Nervous System, physiology

16053174<Sporulation of Bacillus stearothermophilus.<A broth medium containing tryptone and manganese sulfate supported heavy sporulation of Bacillus stearothermophilus ATCC 7953 (NCA 1518) and four isolates identified as B. stearothermophilus. Maximal spore yields were obtained by use of inocula grown anaerobically in a medium containing glucose with aeration of sporulation medium via bubbling. After an extended stationary period, sporulation occurred concurrently with vegetative growth between 6 and 8 hr of incubation at 60 C. Omission of glucose from the inoculum or use of a "young" (2 hr) inoculum abolished the stationary period, but decreased spore yields. A requirement of oxygen for rapid vegetative growth and sporulation was demonstrated. Manganese (15 to 30 ppm) stimulated sporulation but did not enhance cell growth.<Bacillus, drug effects, growth &amp; development, Glucose, metabolism, Manganese, pharmacology, Oxygen, pharmacology, Peptones, metabolism, Spores, growth &amp; development, Sulfates, pharmacology

Living, and presumably normal, oysters within the same sample set were also examined. Results indicated that the natural flora of Crassostrea gigas (Thunberg) is composed of organisms representing the genera Pseudomonas, Achromobacter, Flavobacterium, and Vibrio. Pollution indicator organisms such as Escherichia coli were not found. The flora of dead or dying oysters included a somewhat greater incidence of Pseudomonas sp.; a seawater-requiring organism isolated on several occasions from oyster gapers which had been collected from different geographical areas was identified as P. enalia. A description of the organism has been provided, and the characteristics are listed to facilitate identification by other workers encountering the organism in future studies of a similar kind. The seawater requirement exhibited by P. enalia was deduced to be a requirement for sodium chloride for growth of the organism. Experiments to determine the pathogenicity of Pseudomonas enalia were performed by use of experimentally infected animals maintained in aerated seawater tanks. Death of C. gigas occurred when the animal body tissue was injected with viable bacterial cell suspension. Results of histological studies of the normal and infected oyster tissue suggest that bacterial invasion of the tissue occurred.<Alcaligenes, isolation &amp; purification, Bacteria, isolation &amp; purification, Marine Biology, Microscopy, Electron, Mollusca, Pseudomonas, isolation &amp; purification, Vibrio, isolation &amp; purification

The calcitonin concentration was 4 to 40 times that present in hog thyroid, which, as in most other mammals, contains ultimobranchial tissue. The evidence suggests that calcitonin is a fundamental calcium-regulating hormone present in all higher vertebrates and that it is an ultimobranchial rather than a thyroid hormone.

In this temperature range most spontaneously firing neurons were temperature-insensitive, but eight showed sensitivity to the thermal stimulus.

Larvae passed by slug hosts were recovered from lettuce and produced normal infection in white rats. Lettuce sold in the local public market also yielded small numbers of infective larvae. Experimental evidence from rats suggests that the local human population, exposed to repeated low-level infections, may become immunized against the rare massive exposure and against clinical disease that might otherwise result after ingestion of heavily infected raw mollusks.<Animals, Disease Vectors, Humans, Meningoencephalitis, epidemiology, etiology, Nematode Infections, epidemiology, Rats, Snails, Vegetables
16054486<"Reminiscence" in the cold flour beetle (Tenebrio molitor).<Retention of a T-maze task by adults of the species Tenebrio molitor was facilitated by exposure to 1.7 degrees C. The facilitation effect was seen after 1, 3, 4, or 5 days of retention, but is was reversed after 2 days. The increment from day 2 to day 5 was termed "reminiscence." That these effects represented alterations in memory and not nonspecific motivational factors was determined by requiring another group of beetles to reverse their learning of the original task. Since reversal performance was inversely related to relearning, it was concluded that "reminiscence" represented alterations in memory. A multistage memory mechanism in the beetle was postulated.<Animals, Behavior, Animal, Cold Temperature, Coleoptera, Memory, Reversal Learning

Inhibition was strongest when the plants were treated at about daybreak. The rhythmic response was apparently not endogenously controlled, since most of the diurnal effect was lost under conditions of constant light and temperature.<Circadian Rhythm, Gossypium, drug effects, growth &amp; development, Herbicides, pharmacology, Seeds, drug effects
16054809<Photosynthetic utilization of internal carbon dioxide by hollow-stemmed plants.<The hollow stems of wet-meadow and bog plants often contain relatively large amounts of carbon dioxide. The internal carbon dioxide apparently originates from respiration of root and stem cells. Some of this carbon dioxide is fixed photosynthetically by stem tissues and is thus recycled within the plant. Such internal stem photosynthesis would be advantageous, particularly in the early stages of growth in cold, wet, high-altitude environments.<Carbon Dioxide, metabolism, Photosynthesis, Plants, metabolism

When the duct system of the rat parotid was perfused with sweat from patients, marked inhibition of sodium reabsorption was observed. Perfusion with sweat from normal subjects caused no change in sodium reabsorption.

16055756<The effect of malnutrition on the inflammatory response as exhibited by the granuloma pouch of the rat.<In the present experiments, Selye's granuloma pouch technique was applied to the study of the effect of host nutritional state on inflammation and the local tissue response. The normal response of well-nourished laboratory rats fed a diet containing 28% protein to the injection of 1% croton oil into a preformed subcutaneous air sac involved the accumulation of hemorrhagic exudate in the pouch lumen and the progressive thickening of the pouch wall, with the proliferation and maturation of fibroblasts and the eventual laying-down of collagen. In malnourished animals, fed a diet containing only 3-4% protein but adequate in all other nutrients, the above reactions were inhibited. This inhibitory effect was encountered after a relatively short period of deficiency and became more marked as the deficiency progressed. No consistent, clear-cut difference was seen in the leukocytic or neutrophilic response between the two dietary groups after the injection of 1% croton oil. A significantly higher proportion of accidental bacterial infections was found in the pouches of malnourished animals than in those of well-nourished animals. This was considered to be a possible consequence of the depressed inflammatory response in malnourished rats. The advantages of the granuloma pouch as an experimental procedure for the study of local reactions to different noxae, and the influence of malnutrition on these reactions have been discussed and suggestions for future studies presented.<Animals, Collagen, biosynthesis, Croton Oil, Dietary Proteins, Exudates and Transudates, Female, Fibroblasts, physiology, Granulation Tissue, pathology, Granuloma, chemically induced, Growth, physiology, Infections, physiopathology, Inflammation, physiopathology, Leukocyte Count, Leukocytosis, physiopathology, Lymphocytes, Male, Microscopy, Neutrophils, Protein Deficiency, physiopathology, Rats, Transillumination, Wound Healing, physiology
16055757<Studies on the nonspecific depression of the immune response.<Calf serum has been shown to suppress the primary immune response to erythrocytes and some bacterial antigens in mice if administered prior to and not after immunization. The importance of the route of iniection of antigens and immunosuppressant is indicated. It is suggested that immunosuppression is achieved by phagocytosis and enyzmatic destruction of the injected antigen by peritoneal macrophages. A similar mechanism is probably involved in the type of immunosuppression induced by PHA.<Animals, Antibody Formation, Antigen-Antibody Reactions, Antigens, Bacteria, immunology, Cattle, Chickens, Erythrocytes, immunology, Horses, Immune Sera, Immunosuppressive Agents, pharmacology, Injections, Intraperitoneal, Lectins, pharmacology, Macrophages, physiology, Mice, Peritoneal Cavity, cytology, Phagocytosis, physiology, Rabbits
16055758<The immune response to a hybrid protein molecule; specificity of secondary stimulation and of tolerance induction.<Upon immunization with LDH-III (subunit composition AABB) rabbits produce anti-A and anti-B antibodies in comparable amounts. These antibodies fit equally well to the hybrid enzyme and to LDH-V (AAAA) or LDH-I (BBBB) respectively, as tested by passive hemagglutination inhibition. No antibodies reacting with both LDH-I and LDH-V were detected. A minority of hybrid-specific antibodies was, however, present in the sera. Animals primed with LDH-III respond regularly to a boosting injection of LDH-V with the production of large amounts of anti-A (but not anti-B) antibodies. A similar injection of LDH-I stimulates (if it has any effect at all) the production of anti-B antibodies only. Stimulation with one of the pure types does not impair a subsequent response to the other. The majority of the animals primed with LDH-III responded not at all or weakly to a boosting injection of LDH-I, though antibodies to LDH-I were present in the sera at the time of stimulation. This effect can hardly be explained on the basis of serological sepcificity. Hyporesponsiveness to LDH-III can be induced by injection of LDH-V into the newborn. Both anti-A and anti-B titers are equally depressed. Within the dose range tested, LDH-I does not exert any tolerogenic action with respect to LDH-III. The carrier property of subunit A is evident in the induction of both immunity and tolerance to LDH-III. The early phase of the immune response to the hybrid enzyme may be carrier-specific, and receptors for the haptenic subunit B may not exist at that stage.<Animals, Animals, Newborn, Antibodies, analysis, Antibody Formation, Antigen-Antibody Reactions, Columbidae, Electrophoresis, Hemagglutination Inhibition Tests, Immune Tolerance, Immunochemistry, Isoenzymes, L-Lactate Dehydrogenase, Precipitin Tests, Proteins, Rabbits, Swine
16055759<Quantitative studies on the mixed lymphocyte interaction in rats. I. Conditions and parameters of response.<Some of the conditions and parameters of the proliferative response in the mixed lymphocyte interaction have been studied with the use of culture inocula consisting of lymphoid cells from various immunogenetically diverse, isogenic strains of rats. Procedures are described by which consistent culture responses can be obtained which are measurable in terms of incorporation of radioactive thymidine into a trichloroacetic acid precipitable cell fraction. Results of experiments with this "mixed lymphocyte interaction" show that (a) Incorporation of thymidine into the mixed cultures is detectable only during and after the 4th day of incubation. Use of culture inocula derived from the thoracic duct or partially purified suspensions of lymphocytes from the peripheral blood provides further evidence that it is the small lymphocyte which synthesizes DNA in these cultures. The addition of peritoneal exudate cells, presumably containing some macrophages, to the mixed lymphocyte cultures does not alter the kinetics of the response. (b) Proliferative responses occur in mixed cultures of cells only when the donors differ by alleles at the important Ag-B histocompatibility locus. (c) Proliferative reactivity in mixed cultures of lymphocytes from parental and hybrid donors is unidirectional. With the use of chromosomally marked cells from donors of different sexes, it was established that only parental lymphocytes are dividing in mixed cultures of parental and hybrid cells. The results of these experiments strongly support the premise that the proliferative response in mixed cultures of lymphocytes represents a de novo immunologic reaction on the cellular level against histocompatibility antigens.<Animals, Antigen-Antibody Reactions, Cattle, Culture Techniques, DNA, biosynthesis, Genetics, Humans, Isoantigens, Lectins, pharmacology, Lymphocytes, immunology, metabolism, Macrophages, immunology, Mitomycins, pharmacology, Mitosis, Peritoneal Cavity, cytology, Rabbits, Rats, Thymidine, Tissue Donors, Transplantation Immunology, Tritium
16055760<Quantitative studies on the mixed lymphocyte interaction in rats. II. Relationship of the proliferative response to the immunologic status of the donors.<The influence of the immunologic status of the cell donors on the proliferative behavior of rat lymphocytes in the mixed lymphocyte interaction has been studied. Mixed cultures of cells from various parental and F(1) combinations having morphologically distinguishable sex chromosomes exhibited unidirectional proliferative reactivity. The mitotic figures were predominately of parental origin. Lymphocytes from donors made tolerant at birth to homologous transplantation isoantigens were specifically unreactive against cells bearing antigens of the tolerance inducing strain, but not to indifferent third party homologous lymphocytes. Cells from animals that had been surgically thymectomized at birth exhibited a markedly and sometimes totally diminished reactivity against homologous lymphocytes. Presensitization of the cell donors resulted in a curtailment of proliferative reactivity in cultures with cells bearing the immunizing antigens. This may reflect the destructive properties that lymphocytes from sensitized animals are known to possess. The results of these experiments show that the proliferative activity of lymphocytes in the mixed lymphocyte interaction accurately reflects the immunologic status of the cell donors, and these findings provide further support for the premise that the mixed lymphocyte interaction represents a primary immunologic response by cells in culture against homologous cells bearing histocompatibility antigens.<Animals, Animals, Newborn, Antigen-Antibody Reactions, Chromosome Mapping, Culture Techniques, Immune Tolerance, physiology, Isoantigens, Lymphocytes, immunology, Mitosis, Rats, Thymectomy, Tissue Donors, Transplantation Immunology, Transplantation, Homologous

16055863<The circulation analysis of serial use: numbers game or key to service?<The conventionally erected and reported circulation analysis of serial use in the individual and the feeder library is found to be statistically invalid and misleading, since it measures neither the intellectual use of the serial's contents nor the physical handlings of serial units, and is nonrepresentative of the in-depth library use of serials. It fails utterly to report or even to suggest the relation of intralibrary and interlibrary serial resources. The actual mechanics of the serial use analysis, and the active variables in the library situation which affect serial use, are demonstrated in a simulated analysis and are explained at length. A positive design is offered for the objective gathering and reporting of data on the local intellectual use and physical handling of serials and the relating of resources. Data gathering in the feeder library, and implications for the extension of the feeder library's resources, are discussed.<Libraries, Medical, Library Surveys

16055989<Stationary phase of cultured mammalian cells (L5178Y).<The stationary phase of the mammalian cells L5178Y in culture can be divided into two stages: (a) an early phase characterized by the decline of mitotic index, followed by a stabilization of the cell number, and (b) a late stage, occurring several hours after the flattening of the growth curve, during which dead or dying cells appear in the cultures. The estimates of rates of cell progress showed that the rates from G(1) to S and from G(2) to M were affected in the early stationary phase. The main cause of cessation of increase in cell number in the early stationary phase is resulted from the decline in mitotic index, which is caused by prolongation of the G(2) period.

16055990<Localization of structural polymers in the cell wall of Neurospora crassa.<The distribution and localization of structural polymers in the cell wall of Neurospora crassa has been studied by selective removal and light and electron microscope examination. Observations with the light microscope indicated that each polymer by itself can provide structural integrity to the cell wall. Examination by electron microscopy showed that the cell wall consists of an outer layer of thick fibrils, identified chemically as a glucan-peptide-galactosamine complex, and an inner layer made up of beta-1,3 glucan and thin fibrils of chitin.<Amino Sugars, analysis, Cell Wall, analysis, Chitin, analysis, Chitinases, pharmacology, Histocytochemistry, Microscopy, Microscopy, Electron, Neurospora, cytology, Streptomyces, enzymology, Zymosan, analysis
16055991<Functions of coated vesicles during protein absorption in the rat vas deferens.<The role of coated vesicles during the absorption of horseradish peroxidase was investigated in the epithelium of the rat vas deferens by electron microscopy and cytochemistry. Peroxidase was introduced into the vas lumen in vivo. Tissue was excised at selected intervals, fixed in formaldehyde-glutaraldehyde, sectioned without freezing, incubated in Karnovsky's medium, postfixed in OsO(4), and processed for electron microscopy. Some controls and peroxidase-perfused specimens were incubated with TPP,(1) GP, and CMP. Attention was focused on the Golgi complex, apical multivesicular bodies, and two populations of coated vesicles; large (&gt; 1000 A) ones concentrated in the apical cytoplasm and small (&lt;750 A) ones found primarily in the Golgi region. 10 min after peroxidase injection, the tracer is found adhering to the surface plasmalemma, concentrated in bristle-coated invaginations, and within large coated vesicles. After 20-45 min, it is present in large smooth vesicles, apical multivesicular bodies, and dense bodies. Peroxidase is not seen in small coated vesicles at any interval. Counts of small coated vesicles reveal that during peroxidase absorption they first increase in number in the Golgi region and later, in the apical cytoplasm. In both control and peroxidase-perfused specimens incubated with TPP, reaction product is seen in several Golgi cisternae and in small coated vesicles in the Golgi region. With GP, reaction product is seen in one to two Golgi cisternae, multivesicular bodies, dense bodies, and small coated vesicles present in the Golgi region or near multivesicular bodies. The results demonstrate that (a) this epithelium functions in the absorption of protein from the duct lumen, (b) large coated vesicles serve as heterophagosomes to transport absorbed protein to lysosomes, and (c) some small coated vesicles serve as primary lysosomes to transport hydrolytic enzymes from the Golgi complex to multivesicular bodies.<Acid Phosphatase, metabolism, Animals, Biological Transport, Cytoplasm, Epithelium, physiology, Golgi Apparatus, Histocytochemistry, Lysosomes, metabolism, Male, Microscopy, Electron, Peroxidases, metabolism, Proteins, metabolism, Pyrophosphatases, metabolism, Rats, Vas Deferens, cytology, metabolism
16055992<Microspectrophotometric analysis of nuclear DNA in Chara zeylanica.<Microspectrophotometric analysis of the DNA content of nuclei in various parts of Chara zeylanica Willd. revealed that the amount of DNA in the nucleus of an internodal cell equals twice the amount of DNA in the nucleus of a sperm, while the half-anaphase stage of the same nodal cells contains the same amount of DNA as the nuclei of the male gametes. The DNA content of the nuclei of internodal cells may rise as much as 50 times higher than that of the gametes. However, in the oldest (most basal) internodal cells, the DNA content of the minute nuclei falls again to the basic (1 C) amount. Measurements of sister nuclei derived by amitosis indicated that both nuclei have equal amounts of DNA; this was interpreted as further evidence that amitosis is not a disorganized process or manifestation of degeneration. The bearing of these analyses on the question of the site of meiosis in these plants is discussed.<Cell Nucleus, metabolism, DNA, metabolism, Meiosis, Mitosis, Plant Cells, Plants, metabolism, Spectrophotometry
16055993<Spheroidal and ring nucleoli in amphibian oocytes. Patterns of uridine incorporation and fine structural features.<In maturing oocytes of the newt Triturus viridescens, the nucleoli undergo a series of morphological changes that are very similar to those described by Callan for the axolotl, Ambystoma mexicanum. The nucleoli first assume the form of spheroids which then become extended into ring or necklace shapes that are DNase-sensitive; in mature oocytes the nucleoli revert to a spheroidal form. Short term in vitro incorporation studies with uridine-(3)H on both species show that RNA synthesis occurs in a restricted, eccentric portion of the spheroidal nucleoli, thereby producing an asymmetrical pattern of labeling. In the ring forms, however, the localization of the radioactivity suggests that synthesis takes place symmetrically throughout their entire length. The changes in nucleolar morphology apparently reflect the fact that the component DNA has undergone a redistribution from a localized region in the spheroidal nucleoli to an extended circle in the rings; the patterns of uridine-(3)H incorporation, therefore, parallel the distribution of DNA in both the spheroidal and the ring nucleoli. Ultrastructurally, the nucleoli contain a fibrillar component that corresponds in position to that of the DNA. The typical spheroidal nucleolus consists of a fibrillar core situated eccentrically and surrounded by a hull of granular, ribonucleoprotein material. The ring nucleoli are composed of a central fibrous region that is ensheathed all around its circumference by a layer of similar granular material. This granular substance is thicker at intervals along the length of the rings, representing the "beads" of the necklaces.<Animals, Autoradiography, Cell Nucleolus, DNA, biosynthesis, Deoxyribonucleases, metabolism, Female, Meiosis, Microscopy, Electron, Nucleoproteins, Ovum, cytology, RNA, biosynthesis, Tritium, Uridine, metabolism, Urodela, cytology
16056010<Nonlinear transient responses from light-adapted wolf spider eyes to changes in background illumination.<Retinal action potentials were recorded at the corneas of light-adapted wolf spider eyes in response to large positive and negative step changes in background illumination. These incremental responses were superimposed upon the steady-state DC responses to the background illumination. Both positive and negative step responses had peaks which overshot the DC levels to which they decayed. The overshoot was greater for positive than for negative steps. Short term DC responses measured after one-half sec were larger for negative than for positive steps; these short-term DC responses were thus asymmetrical. However, responses to short positive and negative flashes were not asymmetrical; rather, they varied linearly with flash amplitude. Asymmetries were thus delayed in onset. The short-term DC responses were found to be different from the steady-state DC responses to maintained changes in background illumination. There was an approximately exponential decay or creep from the short-term to the steady-state DC responses. It is proposed that the dynamics of delayed asymmetries can explain the waveforms of the short-term transient responses.<Action Potentials, Animals, Electrophysiology, instrumentation, Insecta, physiology, Light, Retina, physiology
16056011<A nonlinear model for transient responses from light-adapted wolf spider eyes.<A quantitative model is proposed to test the hypothesis that the dynamics of nonlinearities in retinal action potentials from light-adapted wolf spider eyes may be due to delayed asymmetries in responses of the visual cells. For purposes of calculation, these delayed asymmetries are generated in an analogue by a time-variant resistance. It is first shown that for small incremental stimuli, the linear behavior of such a resistance describes peaking and low frequency phase lead in frequency responses of the eye to sinusoidal modulations of background illumination. It also describes the overshoots in linear step responses. It is next shown that the analogue accounts for nonlinear transient and short term DC responses to large positive and negative step stimuli and for the variations in these responses with changes in degree of light adaptation. Finally, a physiological model is proposed in which the delayed asymmetries in response are attributed to delayed rectification by the visual cell membrane. In this model, cascaded chemical reactions may serve to transduce visual stimuli into membrane resistance changes.<Action Potentials, Animals, Insecta, physiology, Light, Membrane Potentials, Models, Biological, Models, Theoretical, Retina, physiology
16056012<The ultrastructural route of fluid transport in rabbit gall bladder.<The route of fluid transport across the wall of the rabbit gall bladder has been examined by combined physiological and morphological techniques. Fluid transport was either made maximal or was inhibited by one of six physiological methods (metabolic inhibition with cyanide-iodoacetate, addition of ouabain, application of adverse osmotic gradients, low temperature, replacement of Cl by SO(4), or replacement of NaCl by sucrose). Then the organ was rapidly fixed and subsequently embedded, sectioned, and examined by light and electron microscopy. The structure of the gall bladder is presented with the aid of electron micrographs, and changes in structure are described and quantitated. The most significant morphological feature seems to be long, narrow, complex channels between adjacent epithelial cells; these spaces are closed by tight junctions at the luminal surface of the epithelium but are open at the basal surface. They are dilated when maximal fluid transport occurs, but are collapsed under all the conditions which inhibit transport. Additional observations and experiments make it possible to conclude that this dilation is the result of fluid transport through the spaces. Evidently NaCl is constantly pumped from the epithelial cells into the spaces, making them hypertonic, so that water follows osmotically. It is suggested that these spaces may represent a "standing-gradient flow system," in which osmotic equilibration takes place progressively along the length of a long channel.<Animals, Biological Transport, Active, physiology, Chlorides, metabolism, Cyanides, pharmacology, Gallbladder, cytology, drug effects, physiology, Iodoacetates, pharmacology, Microscopy, Microscopy, Electron, Osmosis, Ouabain, pharmacology, Rabbits, Sodium Chloride, Sucrose, pharmacology, Temperature
16056013<Ion effects on calcium accumulation by cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum.<The effects of monovalent cations on the active calcium-accumulating ability of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum were assessed. Grana prepared in an ion-free system accumulated calcium when ATP and Mg(++) were present. Sodium ion and to a lesser extent lithium but not K(+) reduced the amount of calcium taken up. The reduction of calcium binding by Na(+) is not due to inhibition of uptake but to a rapid release of the radiocalcium bound. The amount of calcium released by sodium does not appear to be enough to explain contraction on the basis of sodium influx into muscle, but may be significant in the regulation of tension.<Adenosine Triphosphate, pharmacology, Animals, Biological Transport, Calcium, metabolism, Endoplasmic Reticulum, drug effects, metabolism, Lithium, pharmacology, Magnesium, pharmacology, Muscle Contraction, Myocardium, metabolism, Potassium, pharmacology, Rabbits, Sodium, pharmacology
16056014<Conduction velocity and intracellular action potentials of the tunicate heart.<The tubular heart of tunicates is composed of a single layer of myoendothelial cells. The direction of contraction reverses every few minutes. The conduction times in both directions are the same. Conduction velocity was greatest in the middle of the arms of the V-shaped heart and slowest in the apex. The greater the heart length, the greater was the conduction velocity. The Q(10) of conduction velocity was 2-2.3. Removal of the raphe which attaches the heart to the pericardium and removal of a line of undifferentiated cells opposite the raphe did not change the conduction velocity or prevent the heart from reversing the direction of conduction. The median resting potential of 42 cells was -71 mv and the median action potential was 75 mv. At 20 degrees C the duration of the action potential was 1.2 sec and the maximal rate of depolarization was 3-10 v/sec. An increase in the beat frequency produced by electrically stimulating the heart decreased the resting potential, rate of rise, the duration, and the overshoot of the action potential. The shape of the action potential was sometimes different in the two directions of conduction. The electrophysiological evidence indicates only one cell type and suggests that the mode of the spread of excitation is by local current flow from cell to cell.<Action Potentials, Animals, Chordata, Nonvertebrate, physiology, Electric Stimulation, Heart Conduction System, physiology, Muscle Contraction, Physical Phenomena, Physics

16056620<A determination of the sub-units of arachin by osmometry. Arachins A, B, and A1.<1. Osmotic pressure determinations of dissociated arachins are a particularly suitable method for determination of the number of sub-units in the protein, because they yield a number-average molecular weight. 2. Arachin, in 8m-urea-0.1m-sulphite, produces 12 sub-units from the form of molecular weight 345000. 3. When the urea concentration is varied the molecules became fully dissociated at 6m-urea-0.1m-sulphite. Although sulphite is necessary to break disulphide bridges, concentrations greater than 0.1m cause a re-aggregation of the sub-units. Similar results were obtained in guanidine solutions. 4. A new form of arachin has been discovered, A1, migrating more rapidly than arachin A. 5. The N-terminal residues of arachin have been re-investigated on more highly purified samples: they are glycine, valine and (iso)leucine in the proportions 4:1:1. 6. The three forms of arachin have the structure (B) beta(4)gammadelta, (A) alpha(2)beta(2)gammadelta and (A1) alpha(4)gammadelta, for the forms of molecular weight 170000. 7.

The contents of total glucan and total mannan in the walls were relatively little affected by the growth rate under any of the four sets of conditions. The phosphorus and protein contents of walls from yeast grown under each of the four conditions increased as the growth rate was decreased. Walls from yeast grown under NH(4) (+) limitation contained only half as much protein as walls from cells grown under glucose limitation. The proportion of lipid was greatest in walls from yeast grown under NH(4) (+) limitation. 3. A procedure was devised for fractionating isolated walls, based on the ease with which the glucan and mannan were extracted with water and with hot and cold 6% (w/v) potassium hydroxide solution. The percentage of glucan, mannan, protein and phosphorus in each of the fractions was affected by the rate of growth and by the nature of the substrate limitation. 4. The beta-fructofuranosidase activities of yeast grown under glucose limitation increased as the growth rate was lowered, but decreased at very low growth rates. The effects at low growth rates were probably due to repression of enzyme synthesis by residual glucose in the culture filtrate. The beta-fructofuranosidase activities of yeast grown under NH(4) (+) limitation were much lower than those from yeast grown under any of the conditions of glucose limitation. 5. Yeast cells grown at any of the rates under NH(4) (+) limitation were longer and thinner than those grown at the same rate under any of the conditions of glucose limitation. Mean cell volumes were dependent on growth rate but not on the nature of the substrate limitation. 6. Electron micrographs of thin sections of isolated walls showed that cells grown under NH(4) (+) limitation had a more porous structure than those from cells grown under any of the conditions of glucose limitation.<Cell Wall, metabolism, Culture Media, Glucose, metabolism, Glycoside Hydrolases, metabolism, Microscopy, Microscopy, Electron, Nucleic Acids, metabolism, Phosphorus, metabolism, Plant Proteins, metabolism, Polysaccharides, metabolism, Quaternary Ammonium Compounds, pharmacology, Saccharomyces, cytology, metabolism
16056624<Regulation of triglyceride synthesis in the parturient guinea-pig mammary gland.<1. The specific activity of the enzyme palmitoyl-CoA-l-glycerol 3-phosphate palmitoyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.15) in the mammary tissue of guinea pigs has been shown to increase 37-fold at parturition. 2. Increases also occur in tissue concentrations of glycerol 3-phosphate, CoA and free fatty acid, but not in that of acid-insoluble CoA. 3. The isolation and fatty acid composition of plasma triglyceride and of mammary-tissue free fatty acid, diglyceride and triglyceride are described. 4.

16056625<Inhibitors of caeruloplasmin.<1. A method is described by which substances inhibiting caeruloplasmin oxidase activity directly may be distinguished from those acting on stimulatory contaminant iron or on the product of enzyme action. 2. Many previously reported inhibitors, including saturated aliphatic carboxylates, hydrazines, 1,10-phenanthroline, borate and various psycho-active drugs, are found either not to act on the enzyme or to inhibit it only weakly. 3. A series of inorganic anions are compared as inhibitors. Anions such as azide and cyanide with strong copper-binding properties are the most effective inhibitors. There is a general inverse relationship between anion size and inhibitory power. Iodide is anomalous, the order of effectiveness of halides being F(-)&gt;I(-)[unk]Cl(-)&gt;Br(-). 4. Multidentate copperchelating ligands have little inhibitory effect. 5. A group of substances containing the structural unit [unk]C=[unk].CO(2)H, including fumarate and benzoate, cause inhibition. 6. Relative inhibitions by a series of mono-substituted benzoates are inversely related to molecular size. 7. Results are discussed in relation to earlier work on the disposition and function of the copper atoms of caeruloplasmin.<Azides, pharmacology, Benzoates, pharmacology, Ceruloplasmin, antagonists &amp; inhibitors, Chelating Agents, pharmacology, Copper, Cyanides, pharmacology, Dialysis, Fumarates, pharmacology, Halogens, pharmacology, Humans, Ions, pharmacology, Methods, Oxidoreductases, antagonists &amp; inhibitors
16056626<The effect of trypsin digestion on the activities of polynucleotide phosphorylase.<1. Treatment of Micrococcus lysodeikticus polynucleotide phosphorylase (nucleoside diphosphate-polynucleotide nucleotidyltransferase) with trypsin causes a preferential loss of its cytidine diphosphate and uridine diphosphate polymerization activities. 2. The phosphorolytic activity of the enzyme towards polycytidylic acid is unaffected in conditions in which the cytidine diphosphate-polymerization activity without added primer is virtually abolished. 3. The treated enzyme retains its altered pattern of activities when purified fivefold by gel filtration. 4. The effect on the cytidine diphosphate-polymerization activity is due, in part, to a large increase in primer requirement as a result of proteolysis, and is qualitatively independent of the state of purity of the polynucleotide phosphorylase. 5. The enzyme is protected from trypsin degradation by nucleic acids, polynucleotides and nucleoside disphosphates. 6. A similar, but less marked differential effect, is caused by alpha-chymotrypsin.<Carbon Isotopes, Catalysis, Chromatography, Gel, Chymotrypsin, Kinetics, Micrococcus, enzymology, Nucleotidyltransferases, Protein Hydrolysates, Trypsin
16056627<Amino acid metabolism in various fractions of rat-brain homogenates with special reference to the effect of ethanol.<1. The increase in brain gamma-aminobutyrate, glutamate and aspartate and the decrease in brain glutamine that occur when ethanol is administered to rats in vivo could be reproduced by incubating brain homogenates from rats pretreated with ethanol. 2. For the demonstration of the effects of pretreatment with ethanol on the metabolism of gamma-aminobutyrate and glutamine, the whole homogenate could be replaced by various supernatant preparations, and even by the soluble protein fraction, which was less active, however. The ;postmitochondrial' sediment could likewise mediate the effects of pretreatment with ethanol. 3. When the brain homogenates from control and ethanol-treated rats were allowed to ;age' at 2 degrees for more than 7 days, the metabolic difference at incubation could no longer be demonstrated. The capacities of the homogenate from the control rats had changed to resemble those of ethanol-treated rats. 4.

16056628<Methane production from glucose in vitro by mixed rumen bacteria.<1. Methane was produced in vitro by incubating cell suspensions of rumen bacteria with glucose, under nitrogen. The amount of methane produced varied considerably and was lowered by high glucose concentrations. Carbon dioxide, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid and lactic acid were also produced. An oxidation-reduction balance of near unity could be calculated, although carbon recovery was low. Under the experimental conditions, rumen bacteria used most of the metabolic hydrogen produced during the oxidation of glucose to form lactic acid. 2. Lower methane production at high glucose concentrations was balanced by higher lactic acid production. Low pH values due to a high production rate of lactic acid might explain the inhibition of methane production. 3. No lactic acid, less methane, but considerably more propionic acid were formed when nitrogen was replaced by carbon dioxide in the incubation system.<Acetates, metabolism, Animals, Butyrates, metabolism, Carbon Dioxide, metabolism, Carbon Isotopes, Fermentation, Fistula, Glucose, metabolism, Hydrogen, metabolism, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Lactates, metabolism, Methane, biosynthesis, Oxidation-Reduction, Propionates, metabolism, Rumen, microbiology, Sheep
16056629<The hydrolysis of algal galactans by enzymes from a Cytophaga species.<1. Two bacteria were isolated from sea water by the enrichment culture technique, both of which could utilize the galactan sulphate, porphyran, as sole source of carbon. 2. From the cells of one bacterium, classified as a Cytophaga sp., hydrolytic enzymes were isolated. 3. Partial purification of the enzymes is described and some of the properties of the principal enzymes have been studied. 4. The action of the enzymes on several galactan sulphates of red algae suggests that an agarase is present in the mixture.<Chemical Precipitation, Chromatography, Gel, Culture Media, Cytophaga, enzymology, Eukaryota, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Polysaccharides, Viscosity
16056630<Metabolic phases during the development of granulation tissue.<1. The metabolism of incubated slices of sponge-induced granulation tissue, harvested 4-90 days after the implantation, was studied with special reference to the capacity of collagen synthesis and to the energy metabolism. Data are also given on the nucleic acid contents during the observation period. Three metabolic phases were evident. 2. The viability of the slices for the synthesis of collagen was studied in various conditions. Freezing and homogenization destroyed the capacity of the tissue to incorporate proline into collagen. 3. Consumption of oxygen reached the maximum at 30-40 days. There was evidence that the pentose phosphate cycle was important, especially during the phases of the proliferation and the involution. The formation of lactic acid was maximal at about 20 days. 4. The capacity to incorporate proline into collagen hydroxyproline in vitro was limited to a relatively short period at 10-30 days. 5. The synthesis of collagen was dependent on the supply of oxygen and glucose, which latter could be replaced in the incubation medium by other monosaccharides but not by the metabolites of glucose or tricarboxylic acid-cycle intermediates.<Animals, Back, Carbon Isotopes, Cellulose, Collagen, biosynthesis, Glucose, metabolism, Granulation Tissue, metabolism, Granuloma, metabolism, Hydroxyproline, metabolism, Male, Oxygen Consumption, Proline, metabolism, Rats, Time Factors
16056631<Fatty acid changes in liver and plasma lipid fractions after safflower oil was fed to rats deficient in essential fatty acids.<1. Fatty acid patterns of liver and plasma triglycerides, phospholipids and cholesteryl esters were determined at intervals during 24hr. after essential fatty acid-deficient rats were given one feeding of linoleate (as safflower oil). 2. Liver triglyceride, phospholipid and cholesteryl ester fatty acid compositions did not change up to 7hr. after feeding. Between 7 and 10hr., linoleic acid began to increase in all fractions, but arachidonic acid did not begin to rise in the phospholipid until 14-19hr. after feeding. 3. Oleic acid and eicosatrienoic acid in liver phospholipid began to decline at about the time that linoleic acid increased, i.e. about 9hr. before arachidonic acid began to increase. 4. Changes in linoleic acid, arachidonic acid and eicosatrienoic acid in phosphatidylcholine resembled those of the total phospholipid. Phosphatidylethanolamine had a higher percentage content of arachidonic acid before the linoleate was given than did phosphatidylcholine, and after the linoleate was given the fatty acid composition of this fraction was little changed. 5. The behaviour of the plasma lipid fatty acids was similar to that of the liver lipids, with changes in linoleic acid, eicosatrienoic acid and arachidonic acid appearing at the same times as they occurred in the liver. 6. The results indicated that linoleic acid was preferentially incorporated into the liver phospholipid at the expense of eicosatrienoic acid and oleic acid. The decline in these fatty acids apparently resulted from their competition with linoleic acid for available sites in the phospholipids rather than from any direct replacement by arachidonic acid.<Animals, Cholesterol, metabolism, Chromatography, Gas, Chromatography, Thin Layer, Fatty Acids, blood, metabolism, Fatty Acids, Essential, metabolism, Lipids, blood, Liver, metabolism, Male, Phospholipids, blood, metabolism, Rats, Triglycerides, blood, metabolism
16056632<The biosynthesis of 5-hydroxytryptamine in brain.<1. Studies on the anatomical distribution of tryptophan 5-hydroxylase in dog brain show that the activity of this enzyme parallels the activity of 5-hydroxytryptophan decarboxylase and the concentration of 5-hydroxytryptamine in various areas of the brain. 2. Subcellular fractionation of homogenates of rabbit hind-brain has shown that at least 40% of the tryptophan 5-hydroxylase activity is associated with the crude mitochondrial fraction; equilibrium centrifugation in a discontinuous sucrose gradient suggests that this particulate tryptophan 5-hydroxylase is localized in the synaptosomes (nerve-ending particles). 3. Attempts to increase the activity of tryptophan 5-hydroxylase in iso-osmotic homogenates of brain by adding 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-6,7-dimethylpteridine failed. 4. Procedures designed to rupture synaptosomes caused a fall in the activity of tryptophan 5-hydroxylase, which fall was reversed by adding 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-6,7-dimethylpteridine. This suggested either that the intact synaptosome, in which the tryptophan 5-hydroxylase is localized, contained an optimum amount of the pteridine, or that the pteridine could not pass across the nerve-cell membrane. 5. Partial purification of tryptophan 5-hydroxylase from brain preparations by ammonium sulphate precipitation revealed that the enzyme was completely dependent on 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-6,7-dimethylpteridine for activity.<Aldehyde-Lyases, metabolism, Animals, Brain, cytology, enzymology, Brain Chemistry, Carbon Isotopes, Centrifugation, Density Gradient, Dogs, Microscopy, Electron, Nerve Endings, enzymology, Pteridines, pharmacology, Rabbits, Serotonin, biosynthesis
16056633<Purification of an acid alpha-glucosidase by dextran-gel filtration.<1. The behaviour of rat liver alpha-glucosidases on dextran gel (Sephadex G-100) columns was studied. A ;retardation' of an acid alpha-glucosidase activity was observed. This activity was identified as lysosome alpha-(1--&gt;4)-glucosidase. A single gel-filtration step resulted in a 700-fold purification of the enzyme. The same technique was also used to purify the acid alpha-glucosidase of human kidney. 2. The acid alpha-glucosidases of both tissues show very similar pH optima when tested with maltose or glycogen as substrate.<Animals, Chromatography, Gel, Glucosidases, analysis, Humans, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Kidney, enzymology, Liver, enzymology, Male, Rats
16056635<Amino acid composition of human fibrinogen and anticoagulant derivatives.<1. The amino acid compositions of human fibrinogen and three intermediate anticoagulant derivatives were determined by column chromatography. The derivatives were isolated by ammonium sulphate fractionation and column electrophoresis from solutions of fibrinogen undergoing spontaneous breakdown. One derivative, isolated as the large electrophoretic peak at the end of the clottable period (100% CP) of the parent fibrinogen solution, was labelled LP(100) and others obtained at twice this period (200% CP) were designated as LP(200) and SP(200) (LP, large peak; SP, small peak). 2. Maximal ;molecular' weights of approx. 294000 for LP(100), 137000 for LP(200) and 37000 for SP(200) were calculated for the protein moieties. At least 265 amino acid residues must have been lost from each fibrinogen molecule during the formation of LP(100), and 1362 during the formation of the other two derivatives. 3. Only one derivative (LP(200)) had a partial specific volume ([unk] 0.725ml./g.) different from that of fibrinogen ([unk] 0.721ml./g.). 4. No significant differences in refractive index at 589mmu were detected. 5. Calculation of the total number of ionizable groups/10(5)g. of each protein moiety showed a preponderance of the following numbers of negative charges: 22 in fibrinogen; 24 in LP(100); 26 in LP(200); 49 in SP(200). The isoionic points were estimated to be approx.+0.03pH unit (for fibrinogen), -0.06pH unit for (LP(100)) and +0.28pH unit (for LP(200)) from the pK of imidazole, and 0.78pH unit above the average pK of aspartyl and glutamyl ions (for SP(200)). These figures agree closely with experimentally determined values of the isoelectric point of fibrinogen and its derivatives.<Amino Acids, analysis, Anticoagulants, analysis, Autoanalysis, Chemical Phenomena, Chemistry, Physical, Fibrinogen, analysis, Humans, Trypsin Inhibitors
16056634<3-methylhistidine in actin and other muscle proteins.<1. By the use of the extended elution system for basic amino acid analysis, 3-methylhistidine has been detected in hydrolysates of actin isolated from mammalian, fish and bird skeletal muscle. 2. Evidence is presented to indicate that 3-methylhistidine forms part of the primary structure and that in rabbit actin this residue is restricted to one peptide fraction obtained from the tryptic digest. 3. Rabbit skeletal-muscle actin has a 3-methylhistidine:histidine ratio 1:7.6, indicating a minimum molecular weight of 47600. 4. Adult rabbit myosin contains approximately 2 3-methylhistidine residues/mol. These residues are localized in the heavy meromyosin part of the molecule, and are restricted to the major component obtained after succinylation.<Amino Acids, analysis, Animals, Autoanalysis, Chickens, Chromatography, Ion Exchange, Electrophoresis, Histidine, analysis, Humans, Molecular Weight, Muscle Proteins, analysis, Peptides, analysis, Rabbits, Salmonidae, Trypsin

Comparison was made between amino acid analyses of peptides of differing electrophoretic and chromatographic mobilities resulting from tryptic and chymotryptic digestion of protein from wild-type and mutant K26, and wild-type and mutant K445 strains, respectively. The analyses demonstrate the substitution of aspartic acid for alanine in mutant K26, and leucine for histidine in mutant K445.

16056638<The purification and properties of isocitrate lyase from Chlorella.<1. Isocitrate lyase (threo-d(s)-isocitrate glyoxylate-lyase, EC 4.1.3.1) has been purified from acetate-adapted cells of Chlorella pyrenoidosa. 2. The final preparation was homogeneous by the criteria of sedimentation, diffusion and polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. 3. The sedimentation coefficient (S(20,w)) was 9.04x10(-13)sec. and the diffusion coefficient (D(20,w)) 4.62x10(-7)cm.(2)/sec.; from these values the molecular weight of the enzyme was calculated to be 170000 and its Stokes radius to be 4.63x10(-7)cm. 4. The elution of the enzyme from Sephadex G-100 was studied and estimates of molecular weight and Stokes radius were obtained from the elution data. 5. The turnover number of the enzyme was 5950moles of glyoxylate formed/min./mole of enzyme at 30 degrees . 6. With threo-d(s)(+)-isocitrate as substrate, the K(m) of the enzyme was 0.023mm.<Buffers, Cellulose, Centrifugation, Zonal, Chromatography, Gel, Chromatography, Ion Exchange, Dialysis, Electrophoresis, Disc, Eukaryota, enzymology, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Kinetics, Lyases, analysis, Molecular Weight, Spectrophotometry
16056639<Metabolic relationships of the isolated fractions of the pectic substances of actively growing sycamore cells.<1. d-Glucose and l-arabinose serve as precursors of the pectic polysaccharides of sycamore suspension-callus tissue. 2. The rates and characteristics of the incorporation of radioactive sucrose, glucose and mesoinositol by sycamore callus tissue have been compared and shown to be different. 3. The time-course of the incorporation of radioactive glucose into the major fractions within the cells has been determined. Approx. 7-10% of the radioactivity incorporated is present in the whole pectin of the cells. 4. A study of the continuous incorporation of radioactive glucose showed that the neutral arabinan-galactan fraction of the pectin quickly became saturated with the radioactive label. During the incorporation of radioactivity from a pulse of radioactive glucose the neutral fraction became progressively less labelled, with a corresponding increase in the radioactivity of the weakly acidic pectinic acid, which is known to contain neutral sugars. 5. When the cells were exposed to a pulse of radioactive l-arabinose, the label accumulated first in the neutral fraction and then after 4hr. it passed to the weakly acidic pectinic acid with a corresponding decrease in the radioactivity of the neutral fraction. 6. The product that was initially labelled during the first hour of exposure of the cells in the stationary phase to radioactive glucose was identified as an incompletely methylated galacturonan in which the radioactivity was present in the anhydrogalacturonide residues. This polysaccharide probably acts as the precursor of the polyuronide portions of both the strongly acidic and weakly acidic pectinic acids. 7. The observations are discussed in relation to the structure of the pectic substances and their function in cell growth and development. A tentative model for their metabolic relationship is put forward.<Arabinose, metabolism, Carbon Isotopes, Culture Media, Electrophoresis, Galactose, metabolism, Glucose, metabolism, Inositol, metabolism, Kinetics, Models, Biological, Pectins, metabolism, Polysaccharides, metabolism, Sucrose, metabolism, Trees, metabolism
16056797<Time-dependent contrast effects in a multiple schedule of food reinforcement.<Four rats were rewarded for running in a wheel under two alternating conditions of food reinforcement. These periods of frequent and infrequent reinforcement, each accompanied by a particular stimulus, were presented a number of times in each daily session. Following shifts from high to low frequency of reinforcement, responding decreased suddenly and markedly, and then recovered within the next few minutes. The magnitude of this temporary depression was an increasing function of the duration of the immediately preceding component of high-frequency reinforcement. A transient elevation in performance, which did not vary with the duration of the prior component, was noted in two subjects following shifts from low to high frequency of reinforcement. The elevation and depression effects did not appear simultaneously during the 48 experimental sessions. A possible relation between the difficulty of the discrimination and the extent of contrast effects is discussed.<Animals, Discrimination, Psychological, Food, Male, Rats, Reinforcement Schedule, Reinforcement, Psychology, Reward
16056798<Effects of reinforcement scheduling on simultaneous discrimination performance.<Pigeons were trained on a discrete-trials, simultaneous discrimination procedure, with confusable stimuli such that asymptotic performance was about 85% correct. Trials were terminated if no response occurred within 2 sec of stimulus onset, so that probability of responding was free to vary. The schedule of reinforcement for correct responses was varied, with the following results: (1) there was no relation between frequency of reinforcement and accuracy of responding. (2) In extinction, the probability of responding fell to low levels, but accuracy remained roughly constant. (3) When reinforcement was available after a fixed number of trials or after a fixed number of correct responses, the probability of responding increased with successive trials after reinforcement, but accuracy was generally constant. (4) When every fifth correct response was reinforced, accuracy decreased immediately after reinforcement if the birds were required to respond on every trial.<Animals, Columbidae, Discrimination Learning, Extinction, Psychological, Male, Probability, Reinforcement Schedule, Reinforcement, Psychology
16056799<The effects of errors on children's performance on a circle-ellipse discrimination.<Children first learned by means of a teaching program to discriminate a circle from relatively flat ellipses. Children in the control group then proceeded into a program which gradually reduced the difference between the circle and the ellipses. They advanced to a finer discrimination when they made a correct choice, and reversed to an easier discrimination after making errors ("backup" procedure). The children made relatively few errors until they approached the region of their difference threshold (empirically determined under the conditions described). When they could no longer discriminate the forms, they learned other bases for responding that could be classified as specifiable error patterns. Children in the experimental group, having learned the preliminary circle-ellipse discrimination, were started at the upper end of the ellipse series, where it was impossible for them to discriminate the forms. The backup procedure returned them to an easier discrimination after they made errors. They made many errors and reversed down through the ellipse series. Eventually, most of the children reached a point in the ellipse series where they abandoned their systematic errors and began to make correct first choices; then they advanced upward through the program. All of the children advanced to ellipse sizes that were much larger than the ellipse size at the point of their furthest descent.<Achievement, Child, Child, Preschool, Discrimination Learning, Form Perception, Humans, Knowledge of Results, Psychological, Programmed Instructions as Topic

During the 18 min, a key peck which completed a 3-min fixed interval produced a stimulus of 0.5-sec duration. The first 3-min fixed interval completed after 18 min resulted in primary reinforcement. Behavior characteristic of fixed-interval schedules was produced on both the 3-min components and the 18-min schedule.

16056801<A rat chamber and electrode procedure for avoidance conditioning.<A method was developed for studying the reactions of rats to aversive shock. The distinctive features were the design of the chamber and a method of restraint that allowed the use of surface electrodes to deliver the shock. Advantages of this method were: (1) accurate specification of the shock actually received by the rat; (2) elimination of all unauthorized escape or avoidance reactions; (3) elimination of the shock scramblers and floor grids required with foot-shock; and, (4) rapid acquisition of performance under various avoidance procedures and various frequencies of shock delivery.<Animals, Avoidance Learning, Conditioning, Operant, Electroshock, Escape Reaction, Male, Psychology, Experimental, instrumentation, Rats
16056803<Some effects of correlation between response-contingent shock and reinforcement.<Rats responded on a two-component chain schedule in which a response-contingent electric shock at the end of the first component was either positively correlated, negatively correlated, or uncorrelated with reinforcement availability in the second component. With 0.4-ma shocks, rate in the first component depended on the shock-reinforcement correlation: when shock and reinforcement availability were positively correlated, after extended exposure to the contingencies, rates exceeded those in the absence of shock; when shock and reinforcement availability were negatively correlated, responding was generally suppressed throughout. The discriminative control of shock over responding in the second component, in which reinforcement was available 50% of the time, also depended somewhat on correlation. However, rate change in the first component was not specifically related to discrimination in the second component. With 0.8-ma shocks, responding was substantially suppressed in the first component at all three values of shock-reinforcement correlations.<Animals, Conditioning, Psychological, Electroshock, Extinction, Psychological, Male, Punishment, Rats, Reinforcement, Psychology
16056804<Interaction between reflexive fighting and cooperative escape.<Subjects separated by a Plexiglas partition were trained to follow a cooperative escape procedure which produced behavior like the escape responding of individual subjects. Removal of the partition produced fighting and less efficient escape. Efficient escape behavior was restored and fighting disappeared when the partition was replaced. Neither increased space nor a moving toy affected escape behavior. The results indicate that switching animals from an isolated to a social situation produced a change in the effect of shock upon escape which was related to shock-induced fighting.<Animals, Competitive Behavior, Electroshock, Escape Reaction, Male, Rats, Social Isolation, Spatial Behavior
16056805<Some statistical treatments compatible with individual organism methodology.<Consider experimental treatments with consequences so irreversible that baseline performance cannot be recovered. The conventional method of assessing the effects of such treatments by statistical means involves separate experimental and control groups. An alternative proposed here is to administer the experimental treatment to each subject, one subject at a time and in a random order; whenever any subject receives the experimental treatment, those subjects which have not yet received it receive a control treatment. This procedure permits results significant at the one-tailed 0.05 level to be obtained with four subjects; if a two-group procedure evaluated by means of the U test is used, a minimum of six subjects is needed for the same significance level. More generally, the procedure permits equal sensitivity to any experimental effect with over 30% fewer subjects than a two-group procedure. Extensions of the basic method are made to a variety of levels of the experimental treatment and to treatments without irreversible effects, and limitations of the method are discussed.<Behavior, Humans, Probability, Psychology, Experimental, Psychometrics, Statistics as Topic
16057121<Varicella pneumonia. A report of 20 cases, with postmortem examination in six.<Twenty cases of primary varicella pneumonia, 16 in adults and four in children, were studied. Two adults and four children died, two of the latter with complicating bacterial infections. In two patients the primary cause of death was severe alveolar-capillary block. Staphylococcal septicemia, midbrain hemorrhage and meningoencephalitis were primarily responsible for death in other patients.Radiologically, the lungs showed diffuse, poorly marginated, nodular lesions, often peribronchial in location, more easily defined in the thinner peripheral lung fields, with an alveolar acinar pattern, tending to coalesce in the hilar and perihilar regions. Pathologically, the cutaneous varicella lesions were matched by similar lesions regularly found in the lungs and pleura, as well as the peritoneum and the liver. The pulmonary nodular lesions corresponded to alveoli, filled with precipitated protein and active inflammatory cellular material, surrounding the bronchioles, which themselves were often involved, and these in turn were surrounded by areas of normally aerated alveoli. Eleven moderately to severely ill patients were treated with antibiotics, six moderately to extremely ill were treated with antibiotics and adrenal cortical steroids. There was no evidence of significant change in the course of the disease resulting from use of steroid therapy.<Adult, Chickenpox, complications, Child, Preschool, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Pneumonia, Viral, etiology
16057122<Suicides in San Mateo County.<The usual surveys of completed suicides, encompassing, as they do, large geographical areas, are of limited value to physicians of a particular community. The unique and differentiating characteristics of the suicides in his locale may be "washed out" in these large surveys.San Mateo County has an annual suicide rate of 17 per 100,000 and a disproportionately high incidence in persons over 65 years old. In this particular county females, widows and Orientals are more prone to suicide than has usually been reported elsewhere. Alcohol was directly or indirectly involved in a significant number of instances. Many of the persons who killed themselves were under a physician's care at the time of self-destruction. There are probably important ecological and sociological variables as well as personal factors involved in the suicidal process that are of significance to any suicide prevention program. It is urged that there be more extensive and comparative research in this important public health problem.<Aged, California, Female, Humans, Male, Suicide, epidemiology, prevention &amp; control

The effect of chemical mutagens on cells and their genetic material is discussed.<Since the discovery of the first potent mutagens over 20 years ago, progress in mutation research has been rapid. Many new mutagens, belonging to a variety of chemical classes, have been discovered, and for some of them the reaction with DNA in vitro has been established. It seems that the findings of these chemical investigations usually also apply to viruses which are treated outside the cell.

16057287<Hydrazine-air fuel cells. Hydrazine-air fuel cells emerge from the laboratory.<A fuel cell is an electrochemical device that continues to generate electrical power as long as reactants are supplied and products are removed at properly controlled rates. An assembly of cells is required within which the conversion of chemical to electrical energy occurs; also required is a set of auxiliary components to supply the reactants and remove the products (including waste heat) under controlled steady-state conditions. In addition to the desired energy-conversion reactions, there are deleterious side reactions that can impair fuel economy. From knowledge of these factors influencing the possible reactions, and guided by principles of elementary chemical thermodynamics, the electrochemist can select optimum conditions for cell performance. It is then the job of the engineer to design auxiliary components and controlling devices to provide the electrochemical cells with the best possible approach to these optimum conditions.<Air, Electrochemistry, instrumentation, Fossil Fuels, Hydrazines, Oxygen, Thermodynamics
16057288<The future of scientific journals. A computer-based system will enable a subscriber to receive a personalized stream of papers.<Since many of the problems that beset readers, authors, and publishers of scientific journals are caused by the growth of science or by the frailties of human nature, we cannot hope for complete solutions. In an effort to make progress, within the framework of the possible, we propose that journals stop binding papers into issues and, instead, distribute to each subscriber a personalized stream of papers, abstracts, and titles. This type of distribution, which has been made possible by the advent of high-speed computers, would not affect the traditional roles of editors, referees, and libraries. We also propose that journals recognize the need for very rapid communication in certain fields, and meet the threat of public preprint-exchange systems in these fields by themselves publishing preprints in an appropriately limited manner.<Computers, Information Systems, Periodicals as Topic, Science
16057289<Undersea penetration by ambient light, and visibility.<Undersea observations from various submersibles reveal penetration by ambient light to depths as great as 700 meters. The range of horizontal viewing under ambient light in offshore tropic and subtropic areas varies from 5 to 6 meters (estimated) at 300-meter depth to more than 60 meters at 183-meter depth. Such observations indicate that ambient light may be usable for undersea tasks to greater depths than was anticipated.<Light, Oceanography, Vision, Ocular

At 4 weeks of age, these chickens and control chickens received lyophilized bovine spinal cord emulsified with complete Freund's adjuvant. Agammaglobulinemic chickens developed the lesions of allergic encephalomyelitis with the same frequency and intensity as the controls.

16057295<Visceral tissue vascularization: an adaptive response to high temperature.<Electrical heat sources implanted in the abdominal cavities of sheep were heated to give initial temperatures of 42 degrees and 45 degrees C at the surfaces of the heaters. During 18 days of constant heating, a vascularized connective-tissue envelope encapsulated the heat sources, and the temperatures at the surfaces of the heaters declined 0.8 degrees and 1.8 degrees C, respectively. The degree of vascularization and the magnitude of the decrease in the surface temperature appeared to be related to the proximity of the tissue's initial temperature to 45 degrees C, a temperature ordinarily considered detrimental to cell structure. The vascularization thus appears to be adaptive.<Adaptation, Physiological, Animals, Blood Vessels, physiology, Cardiac Output, Hot Temperature, Peritoneum, blood supply, Pleura, blood supply, Regional Blood Flow, Sheep

16057297<A direct synaptic connection mediating both excitation and inhibition.<Neurons have generally been thought to produce only one synaptic action on any particular cell which they innervate. An identified interneuron in the abdominal ganglion of Aplysia mediates both direct excitation and inhibition to an identified follower cell. At low firing rates the interneuron produces excitatory postsynaptic potentials; however at higher firing rates these gradually diminish in size and eventually invert to inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. Electrophysiological and pharmacological evidence indicates that the connection between these cells is monosynaptic, and that a single transmitter, acetylcholine, mediates both actions. These opposite synaptic responses appear to result from the transmitter's acting on two types of postsynaptic receptors having different thresholds for activation and different susceptibilities for desensitization.<Acetylcholine, physiology, Action Potentials, Animals, Curare, pharmacology, Ganglia, physiology, Interneurons, physiology, Iontophoresis, Mollusca, Synapses, physiology

16057484<Phase equilibria and structure of dry and hydrated egg lecithin.<The behavior of purified egg lecithin in water has been investigated in relation to the quantity of water present and the temperature. The complete binary phase diagram of egg lecithin-water is presented as well as X-ray diffraction data on selected mixtures. Dry egg lecithin is present in at least partially crystalline form until about 40 degrees C. Above this temperature it forms a "wax-like" phase up to about 88 degrees C. From 88 to 109 degrees C it forms a viscous isotropic phase which gives face-centered cubic spacings by X-ray analysis. Above 110 degrees C its texture is "neat" and the structure is assumed to be lamellar until its final melting point at 231 degrees C. Hydrated lecithin forms (except for a small zone of cubic phase at low water concentrations and high temperature) a lamellar liquid crystalline phase. This phase contains up to 45% water at 20 degrees C. Mixtures containing more water separate into two phases, the lamellar liquid crystalline phase and water. In the melting curve of hydrated lecithin a eutectic is noted at about 16% water and the cubic phase seen when less water is present disappears at this composition of the mixture. These facts, along with previous vapor pressure measurements, suggest that there is a structural change at about 16% water. X-ray diffraction studies of lecithin at 24 degrees C and calculations from these data suggest that the reason for this may be the presence of a "free water layer" when more than 16% water is present.<Eggs, Models, Chemical, Phosphatidylcholines, analysis, Solutions, Temperature, Water, X-Ray Diffraction
16057485<Placental transfer of cholesterol-4-14C into rabbit and guinea pig fetus.<A tracer dose of cholesterol-4-(14)C was given daily in the diet of six pregnant guinea pigs to establish an isotopic steady state. At the time of parturition, maternal and fetal blood and fetal tissues were collected and analyzed for cholesterol content and cholesterol specific activity. A comparison of these specific activities in neonatal and maternal serum indicated that about 22% of the fetal serum cholesterol was transferred from maternal blood. In the newborn, tissues generally had the same cholesterol specific activity as serum. Brain tissue was an exception in having a specific activity only 8.4% of that of serum. Dietary cholesterol did not increase serum cholesterol levels in the newborn but did increase the percentage of fetal cholesterol derived from the maternal circulation. The rapid transfer of cholesterol-4-(14)C across the placenta was indicated by the appearance of this isotope in the newborn 2 days after its administration to pregnant rabbits. A considerable amount of the cholesterol content of newborn guinea pigs and rabbits originated from the maternal blood.<Animals, Animals, Newborn, Carbon Isotopes, Cholesterol, blood, metabolism, Dietary Fats, metabolism, Female, Guinea Pigs, Maternal-Fetal Exchange, Placenta, metabolism, Pregnancy, Pregnancy, Animal, Rabbits

16057487<Effects of prostaglandin E1 on lipolysis and plasma free fatty acids in the fasted rat.<Contrary to published reports, prostaglandin E(1) (PGE(1)) in vitro and in vivo inhibited fasting lipolysis in rats. Adipose tissue lipolysis was inhibited when the tissue was incubated in the presence of PGE(1) and when the compound was administered intravenously. A biphasic plasma free fatty acid (FFA) response was obtained in fasted rats after intravenous injection of 80 micrograms of PGE(1) per kg body weight; plasma FFA concentrations were lowered at 7 min, elevated at 15 min, and at normal concentrations at 30 min. The FFA depression at 7 min was independent of the animal's nutritional state, but the rebound at 15 min did not occur in fed rats. The plasma FFA rebound in fasted rats at 15 min may be a consequence of rapid inactivation of PGE(1), followed by unopposed activity of factors which enhance fasting lipolysis.<Adipose Tissue, drug effects, Animals, Epididymis, drug effects, Fasting, Fatty Acids, Nonesterified, blood, Injections, Intravenous, Lipid Metabolism, Male, Prostaglandins, pharmacology, Rats
16057488<Effects of insulin on glucose metabolism in isolated human fat cells.<Isolated fat cells were used for the study of in vitro effects of insulin on glucose metabolism in human and rat adipose tissue. In human subcutaneous fat cells, effects of insulin could be detected at concentrations of glucose in the medium from 1 to 10 micro moles/ml. Cellular responsiveness was inversely proportional to the glucose level. At a constant concentration of 6 micro moles of glucose per ml, the effects of insulin at various concentrations up to 500 micro U/ml were investigated. At the highest concentration, which gave the maximal response, there was a 100% increase in the conversion of glucose-U-(14)C to glyceride-glycerol and a 40% increase in glucose oxidation. The dose-response curve was steepest between 2 and 20 micro U/ml. Rat epididymal fat cells were much more responsive to insulin. Glucose lipogenesis and pentose cycle activity could also be demonstrated in rat cells, whereas these activities could not be shown in fat cells from human omental and subcutaneous tissue. The findings for human cells are attributed to changes in cellular activity during preparation.<Adipose Tissue, drug effects, Adult, Aged, Animals, Carbon Dioxide, analysis, Carbon Isotopes, Female, Glucose, metabolism, Glycerides, biosynthesis, Humans, In Vitro Techniques, Insulin, pharmacology, Male, Middle Aged, Rats
16057489<Rapid colorimetric micromethod for free fatty acids.<Free fatty acids (FFA), the uranyl ion, and the basic dye Rhodamine B form colored complexes, which are extractable into toluene or benzene. Fatty acids of different chain lengths above C(10) and different degrees of unsaturation gave constant molar yield. Complexes in toluene alone are unstable, especially in the light, but a small amount of aqueous uranyl acetate stabilizes them sufficiently for determination. At constant uranyl and Rhodamine B concentrations, a plot of optical density vs. FFA concentration yields two straight lines of different slope, i.e., a biphasic standard curve. Phospholipids interfere, and must be removed with zeolite during FFA extraction. Recovery of FFA added to rat plasma was very similar to that with titration. Assay of rat and dog plasma samples under fasting and fed conditions gave good agreement with the titration method. Values of human plasma samples tended to be higher by the colorimetric procedure; a few samples gave significant disagreement. The method compares well with previous methods in sensitivity and accuracy, and offers advantages in speed, simplicity, and possibly specificity.<Animals, Colorimetry, Coloring Agents, Dogs, Fatty Acids, Nonesterified, analysis, Humans, Lipoprotein Lipase, blood, Methods, Microchemistry, Palmitic Acids, blood, Phospholipids, pharmacology, Rats, Spectrophotometry, Uranium
16057490<Partition of lipids between emulsified oil and micellar phases of glyceride-bile salt dispersions.<The composition of the emulsified oil and of the micellar phases obtained when a glyceride-fatty acid mixture is dispersed in bile salt solution has been defined. The micellar phase in equilibrium with the emulsified oil phase was obtained by filtration through Millipore filters. The behavior of different lipids in such systems was defined as the partition ratio, micellar/emulsified oil phase (m/o). Partition of fatty acids was found to be strongly dependent on the chain length of the fatty acid and the pH of the dispersion. The curve for partition against pH for oleic acid was interpreted to show a pK(a) for oleic acid in bile salt solution of approximately 7. The partition between micellar and oil phases is given for a series of lipids of different polarity. No significant difference in behavior was found for cholesterol and sitosterol. A relationship was found between the partition m/o and filtration rates through a Millipore filter in micellar solution. The lower the partition coefficient the lower was the rate of filtration. The results obtained are discussed in relation to the mechanism of absorption of fat from the small intestine.<Bile Acids and Salts, Carbon Isotopes, Cholesterol, Emulsions, analysis, Fatty Acids, analysis, Filtration, Glycerides, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Intestinal Absorption, Models, Biological, Solubility, Triolein, Tritium
16057491<Absorption of phytol from dietary chlorophyll in the rat.<The fate of ingested chlorophyll-particularly of the phytol portion of the molecule-was studied. Uniformly (14)C-labeled pheophytin a (the Mg-free derivative of chlorophyll a) was prepared from an extract of tobacco leaves grown in (14)CO(2), and was administered by stomach tube to rats in which the thoracic duct had been cannulated. Only about 2% of the administered radioactivity was absorbed in 24 hr, largely into the thoracic duct lymph. Moreover, only a fraction of this lymph radioactivity was derived from phytol (i.e., was found in phytol, phytenic acid, or phytanic acid). The results indicated that not more than 1-2% of chlorophyll phytol is available for absorption by the rat. Similarly, after the administration of whole spinach or spinach extract (not labeled) to rats, only about 1% of the total phytol content was absorbed into the intestinal lymph. Nearly all of the administered phytol was found in the feces and the contents of the colon, and was still largely in the form of pheophytin. The study also indicated that little of the nonphytol portion of the chlorophyll molecule is absorbed.<Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena, Animals, Carbon Isotopes, Chlorophyll, metabolism, Chromatography, Intestinal Absorption, Palmitic Acids, metabolism, Plants, Edible, analysis, Plants, Toxic, Rats, Terpenes, metabolism, Tobacco, analysis, Tritium
16057492<Quantitative determination of the neutral glycosyl ceramides in human blood.<A method is described for the qualitative and quantitative estimation of four neutral glycosyl ceramides from human plasma and erythrocytes. Total lipids extracted from 50 ml of plasma or packed erythrocytes were separated by silicic acid chromatography into neutral lipids, a fraction of mixed glycolipids that was eluted with acetone-methanol 9:1, and phospholipids. After mild alkali-catalyzed methanolysis to remove contaminants from the crude fraction of glycolipids, individual glycosyl ceramides were isolated by preparative thin-layer chromatography. The oligosaccharide portions of these lipids were characterized by cleavage with methanolic hydrogen chloride and gas chromatography of the O-trimethylsilyl methyl glycosides. It was possible to study the composition of the carbohydrate and sphingolipid base fractions in the same gas chromatographic analysis. With mannitol as an internal standard for gas chromatographic estimation of glucose, concentrations of each of the glycosyl ceramides were determined with a precision of about 10%. Recoveries of the lipids from plasma varied with the complexity of the oligosaccharide moiety and ranged from 94% with glucosyl ceramide to 71% with globoside. Concentrations of the four glycosyl ceramides in plasma and in erythrocytes were determined for samples from young, healthy males. Amounts of glycolipid as low as 0.1 micromole can be determined conveniently by this procedure.<Adult, Cerebrosides, blood, Chromatography, Gas, Chromatography, Thin Layer, Erythrocytes, analysis, Humans, Methods, Oligosaccharides, analysis, Solvents
16057493<Quantitative aspects of free fatty acid metabolism in the fasted rat.<Palmitate-1-(14)C was injected intravenously into unanesthetized, fasted rats. Disappearance of tracer from plasma free fatty acids was studied. A large component of free fatty acid (FFA) recycling was directly demonstrated by reinjection experiments. The latter studies also indicated the existence of an unidentified, rapidly turning over polar lipid in plasma which was synthesized from palmitate-(14)C. The appearance of (14)C in hepatic and extrahepatic triglycerides, in other esters, and in respired CO(2) was also followed. The data were analyzed using a multicompartmental model and a digital computer. Only a small fraction of the triglycerides formed in liver was derived directly from plasma free fatty acids. The major portion of net triglyceride formation appeared to be by way of an intermediate nontriglyceride ester pool which turned over relatively slowly compared to plasma free fatty acids. Initial approximations are as follows ( micromoles of fatty acid per min per 100 g body weight): net free fatty acid mobilization (irreversible disposal) = 2.4; hepatic triglyceride formation directly from plasma free fatty acid = 0.1; total hepatic lipid formation from plasma free fatty acids = 0.5; oxidation of free fatty acids to CO(2) = 0.8; percentage of respired CO(2) from direct oxidation of fatty acids = 12%; extrahepatic triglyceride formation directly from fatty acids = 0.4; total extrahepatic lipid formed directly from fatty acids = 1.2.<Animals, Carbon Dioxide, analysis, Carbon Isotopes, Fasting, Fatty Acids, Nonesterified, blood, Injections, Intravenous, Liver, analysis, Male, Models, Biological, Palmitic Acids, metabolism, Rats, Serum Albumin, Bovine, Triglycerides, analysis
16057494<Positional distribution of isomers of monoenoic fatty acids in animal glycerolipids.<The distributions of the following monoenoic acids were determined [notation: (position of double bond)-(chain length): (no. of double bonds)]: 7-, 9-, and 11-16:1; 7-, 9-, 11-, and 13-18:1; 9-, 11-, and 13-20:1; 9 + 11-22:1 and 13-22:1. As a rule, all isomers of a group show different distribution patterns. In the phospholipids of fish and mammals, the 7- and 13-isomers of 18:1 accumulate in position 1. In triglycerides of mammals fed on fish they accumulate in positions 1 plus 3, and this distribution is shared by 7-16:1 and 11-16:1 and by the groups 20:1 and 22:1. The positional distribution of the acids seems to depend on their structure, the 9-isomers in general accumulating in position 2; but in triglycerides, at least, the origin of the acid also seems to play a directing role, the exogenous acids being incorporated into positions 1 and 3. The variability of the distribution patterns of 9-16:1, 9-18:1, and 11:18:1, which contrasts with the regularity of the patterns for saturated and polyenoic acids, may be connected with the ability of the endogenous monoenoic acids to balance fluctuations in the supply of the exogenous polyenoic acids, and with the role of the fatty acid 9,10-dehydrogenation mechanism in the maintenance of structural and physical properties of phospholipids and triglycerides.<Adipose Tissue, analysis, Alkenes, analysis, Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena, Animals, Cetacea, Chromatography, Gas, Crustacea, Dogs, Ducks, Eggs, analysis, Fatty Acids, analysis, Fishes, Liver, analysis, Milk, analysis, Mink, Phospholipids, analysis, Rats, Swine, Triglycerides, analysis
16057495<Composition of phospholipids and of phospholipid fatty acids and aldehydes in human red cells.<Improved methods for lipid analysis that have been developed recently were employed to reevaluate the phospholipid composition, the fatty acid and fatty aldehyde composition of the total phospholipid, and the fatty acid composition of the individual phospholipids of normal human red cells. Thirty-three fatty acids and five fatty aldehydes were estimated and tentatively identified in the total phospholipid of normal human red cells. Additional minor components were evident. The major individual phospholipids were isolated by silicic acid thin-layer chromatography and quantified. The fatty acid compositions of phosphatidyl ethanolamine, phosphatidyl serine, lecithin, and sphingomyelin were determined. Each of these phospholipids showed a distinctive and characteristic fatty acid pattern.<Adult, Aldehydes, analysis, Chromatography, Gas, Chromatography, Thin Layer, Erythrocytes, analysis, Fasting, Fatty Acids, analysis, Female, Humans, Male, Phosphatidylcholines, analysis, Phosphatidylethanolamines, analysis, Phospholipids, analysis, Sphingomyelins, analysis
16057496<Composition of phospholipids and of phospholipid fatty acids of human plasma.<The composition of the phospholipids and of the total phospholipid fatty acids was determined in the plasma of 10 normal subjects. In addition the fatty acid composition of the plasma phosphatidyl ethanolamine, phosphatidyl serine, lecithin, sphingomyelin, and lysolecithin of 6 of the subjects was measured. A wide array of fatty acids was found in the plasma total phospholipid similar to that found previously in red cell total phospholipid. The fatty acid composition in the plasma phospholipids of a given subject reflected that in his red cell phospholipids. Each individual phospholipid displayed a distinctive fatty acid pattern, which was generally similar to that of the corresponding phospholipid of red cells, although some marked differences in individual fatty acid levels between the corresponding phospholipids of plasma and red cells were evident. The high percentage of unsaturated fatty acids found in plasma lysolecithin suggests that this phospholipid did not arise entirely through the enzymatic cleavage of the -fatty acid of lecithin.<Adult, Chromatography, Gas, Chromatography, Thin Layer, Fasting, Fatty Acids, analysis, Female, Humans, Lysophosphatidylcholines, analysis, Male, Phosphatidylcholines, analysis, Phosphatidylethanolamines, analysis, Phospholipids, blood, Sphingomyelins, analysis
16057497<Effect of propionate on lipogenesis in adipose tissue.<The metabolism of propionate in adipose tissue and its effect on lipogenesis was investigated. Fasting induced changes in propionate metabolism of adipose tissue, drastically reducing higher fatty acid synthesis and increasing glyceride-glyerol formation from low concentrations of propionate (0.25 mM). Propionate also promoted lipogenesis from acetate-1-(14)C in tissues of fasted rats, while it inhibited lipogenesis and CO(2) formation from acetate in the fed animal. Treatment with actinomycin D or ethionine abolished both the increased glyceride-glycerol formation from propionate and the promoting effect on lipogenesis from acetate. Synthesis of long-chain fatty acids from propionate-1-(14)C was increased by actinomycin treatment. The change in propionate metabolism induced by fasting is, however, not entirely due to its conversion to glyceride-glycerol, since the latter was almost completely blocked by malonate while part of the promoting effect on fatty acid synthesis persisted.<Acetates, metabolism, Adipose Tissue, metabolism, Animals, Carbon Isotopes, Dactinomycin, pharmacology, Fasting, Fatty Acids, biosynthesis, Lipids, biosynthesis, Male, Malonates, pharmacology, Propionates, metabolism, Rats, Succinates, pharmacology
16057498<Effect of propionate on pyruvate metabolism in adipose tissue.<Glyceride-glycerol formation in rat adipose tissue from pyruvate-2-(14)C is increased by fasting, while fatty acid synthesis is markedly depressed. In tissues of fasted animals glyceride-glycerol formation is maximal with concentrations of pyruvate exceeding 2.5 mM. With 0.25 mM pyruvate-2-(14)C, glyceride-glycerol formation is increased severalfold by the addition of 0.25 mM propionate. No further increase in synthesis is caused by propionate when pyruvate is supplied in optimal amounts. Addition of equimolar concentrations of acetate or pyruvate does not replace propionate. The effect of propionate on glyceride-glycerol synthesis from pyruvate is also given by a series of even-chain fatty acids. However, only propionate promotes fatty acid synthesis in tissues of fasted and fed animals. Fixation of (14)CO(2) in glyceride-glycerol is dependent on the presence of propionate and is maximal in tissues of fasted rats and when pyruvate is also added. Succinate has no significant effect. Actinomycin treatment blocks glyceride-glycerol synthesis in tissues of fed and fasted animals, in the presence and absence of propionate. At the same time, fatty acid synthesis in tissues of fasted rats is markedly increased.<Adipose Tissue, metabolism, Animals, Carbon Dioxide, metabolism, Carbon Isotopes, Dactinomycin, pharmacology, Fasting, Fatty Acids, biosynthesis, Glycerides, biosynthesis, Male, Propionates, pharmacology, Pyruvates, metabolism, Rats

16057787<Some mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae inhibited by adenoylmethionine and adenosylhomocysteine.<These investigations have established the existence of a novel type of non-nutritional mutant (ai) which is inhibited in the presence of two naturally occurring cellular compounds. The inhibition is complete at an extracellular concentration at least as low as 0.05 mumole/ml of either adenosylhomocysteine or adenosylmethionine. It is suggested that adenosylhomocysteine is the true inhibitor. The ai mutants are phenotypically indistinguishable from the wild type in the absence of inhibitors. The results have shown that, if any direct effect on the methionine biosynthetic pathway exists, it is a secondary rather than the primary effect of the inhibitors. The ai mutation does not involve the loss of the adenosylmethionine (or methylmethionine): homocysteine methyltransferase. In addition, the ai mutants accumulate, maintain, and utilize adenosylmethionine and methionine in a manner similar to the parental strain. No genetic relationship could be detected between the ai-1 mutation and several different markers affecting methionine biosynthesis. The ai-1 mutation was also shown to be genetically recessive. Methionine partially reverses the inhibition caused by adenosylmethionine or adenosylhomocysteine. Neither methylmethionine nor homocysteine reversed the inhibition, which showed that the homocysteine methyltransferase cannot catalyze the synthesis of sufficient methionine under these conditions to simulate the effects of extracellularly supplied methionine. If adenine is present, methionine does not cause reversal of inhibition due to adenosylmethionine or adenosylhomocysteine. From the data presented, it is clear that the ai mutation involves some metabolic control mechanism, though the alteration does not appear to be associated primarily with the biosynthesis of methionine.<Adenine, pharmacology, Carbon Isotopes, Culture Media, Cysteine, pharmacology, Genetic Complementation Test, Genetics, Microbial, Homocysteine, pharmacology, Methionine, biosynthesis, metabolism, pharmacology, Mutation, Nucleosides, pharmacology, Saccharomyces, drug effects, growth &amp; development, Transferases, metabolism
16057788<Reisolation of Staphylococcus salivarius from the human oral cavity.<Twenty-four strains of gram-positive facultative cocci, arranged primarily in small clusters, were isolated from the surface of the human tongue. With the exception of 14 catalase-negative isolates, these strains were identical in cultural and biochemical characteristics and in deoxyribonucleic acid base composition. All cultures produced viscous growth in both liquid and agar media. They fermented glucose anaerobically, reduced nitrate beyond nitrite, were benzidine-positive, and failed to grow in the presence of 5% NaCl or at 45 C. In addition, they exhibited guanine plus cytosine (G + C) contents of 55.4 to 58.3%. These isolates differed from strains of pediococci, aerococci, and micrococci which were included for comparison. On the basis of G + C content, these organisms appear to be intermediate between micrococci and staphylococci; however, on the basis of anaerobic glucose fermentation, it is suggested that they be placed in the genus Staphylococcus. It is proposed that they be recognized as S. salivarius.<Bile Acids and Salts, pharmacology, Carbohydrate Metabolism, Catalase, metabolism, Culture Media, Cytochromes, analysis, Cytosine, analysis, DNA, Bacterial, analysis, Deoxyribonucleases, metabolism, Flavonoids, metabolism, Gelatin, metabolism, Glucose, metabolism, Guanine, analysis, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Indoles, biosynthesis, Ketones, biosynthesis, Nitrates, metabolism, Sodium Chloride, pharmacology, Staphylococcus, classification, enzymology, growth &amp; development, isolation &amp; purification, metabolism, Temperature, Tongue, microbiology, Urea, metabolism

The amount of egg white found to be satisfactory was 10% of the final medium volume. Its conalbumin equivalent was 1.7 mg of conalbumin per ml of final medium. Such modified media are at least the equivalent of the medium recommended for the evaluation of this important characteristic.<Albumins, Chelating Agents, Culture Media, Egg White, Fluorescence, Iron, pharmacology, Iron Chelating Agents, pharmacology, Pigments, Biological, metabolism, Protein Binding, Pseudomonas, growth &amp; development
16057790<Cultural characteristics and fatty acid composition of Corynebacterium acnes.<A detailed study of the cultural characteristics and cellular fatty acid composition of 27 isolates of Corynebacterium acnes was performed to establish the properties by which this organism may be identified and characterized. The fatty acids were extracted directly from whole cells and examined as methyl esters by gas-liquid chromatography. Each strain possessed a similar fatty acid profile which was characterized by a large percentage of C15 branched-chain acid. Uniformity in certain biochemical reactions and cultural characteristics was also observed. All strains were catalase-positive, nonmotile, and urease-negative, reduced nitrate, liquefied gelatin, failed to hydrolyze esculin and starch, and gave a positive methyl red test. Glucose, fructose, and glycerol were fermented, but not lactose, salicin, sucrose, maltose, xylose, or arabinose. Production of hydrogen sulfide and indole, fermentation of mannitol, and hemolytic activity were variable characteristics. Two species of the genus Propionibacterium were also tested and found to be similar to C. acnes both in cultural characteristics and fatty acid composition. The results strengthen previous suggestions that C. acnes should be classified in the genus Propionibacterium.<Acids, biosynthesis, Carbohydrate Metabolism, Caseins, metabolism, Catalase, metabolism, Chromatography, Gas, Corynebacterium, analysis, classification, enzymology, metabolism, Fats, Unsaturated, analysis, Fatty Acids, analysis, Flavonoids, metabolism, Gelatin, metabolism, Hemolysis, Humans, Indoles, biosynthesis, Nitrates, metabolism, Propionibacterium, Starch, metabolism, Sulfides, biosynthesis, Urease, metabolism
16057791<Mechanisms of protection of trehalase against heat inactivation in Neurospora.<The half-life of trehalase and invertase at 65 and 60 C was found to be much greater when intact ascospores of Neurospora tetrasperma were heated, as compared with extracts. By contrast, no protection was afforded these enzymes when they were heated in intact conidia and mycelium of N. crassa or N. tetrasperma. The protective effect of ascospores for trehalase was further investigated by heating ascospore extracts before and after dialysis. The removal of small molecules by dialysis lowered the heat resistance of trehalase significantly in such extracts. When the dialysate from extracts of mycelium, conidia, or ascospores was added to dialyzed enzyme extracts, that from ascospores was by far the most active. However, the same dialysates had only a small protective effect on invertase. The addition of ashed dialysates did not protect trehalase, and trehalose and glucose protected less effectively than the dialysate.<Dialysis, Disaccharides, pharmacology, Glucose, pharmacology, Glycoside Hydrolases, metabolism, Hot Temperature, Neurospora, enzymology, Spores, enzymology
16057792<Purification and properties of staphylococcal delta-hemolysin. I. Production of delta-hemolysin.<Concentrated preparations of staphylococcal delta-hemolysin were obtained by growing selected hemolytic colonies from the 146P strain of Staphylococcus aureus on dialysis membranes laid over Brain Liver Heart agar plates at 37 C for 20 hr under 10% CO(2) and harvesting the growth from five such membranes in 1.0 ml of deionized distilled water. Incubation in a humid environment facilitated this harvesting procedure. Incubation longer than 40 hr or incubation under CO(2) higher than 10 to 20% gave lower yields of delta-lysin. Addition of a sugar, fermented by the organisms, resulted in lower yields of delta-hemolysin. Agar, although separated from the growing cells by the dialysis membrane, did potentiate delta-hemolysin production. Addition of 0.1% agar to the inoculum further enhanced this potentiation. delta-Hemolysin produced in broth or semisolid cultures was excessively diluted with the media. Dialysis membranes prevented this dilution and thus yielded concentrated preparations of delta-hemolysin.<Agar, pharmacology, Carbon Dioxide, pharmacology, Culture Media, Dialysis, Glucose, pharmacology, Hemolysin Proteins, biosynthesis, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Membranes, Artificial, Oligosaccharides, pharmacology, Staphylococcus, growth &amp; development, metabolism, Temperature
16057793<Degradation of streptococcal cell wall antigens in vivo.<Specific chemical modification of group A polysaccharide antigen to the A-variant structure was demonstrated in the lymphoid organs of mice by autoradiography by use of radioantibodies specific for these structures. Both antigenic moieties persisted and were still discerned 10 weeks after injection of the group A cell wall. In rabbit skin, the group A specificity was altered after a prolonged period. Unlike the situation for the mouse, polysaccharide A was not converted to A-variant structure, but another specificity common to both polysaccharides persisted at the site of injection. Mucopeptide, separated from the polysaccharide of group A cell walls, was eliminated from the site of injection in rabbit skin between 4 and 8 hr after injection. Group D streptococcal cell walls were also rapidly eliminated from tissue, and were no longer detectable 8 hr after injection into rabbit skin or 24 hr after injection into mice. The rapid degradation of these structures was correlated with their susceptibility to lysozyme in vitro and was in contrast to the prolonged persistence of group A cell walls, which were completely resistant to egg white lysozyme. This persistence in tissue correlated with the capacity of group A cell wall fragments to induce a chronic inflammatory process, whereas the isolated mucopeptide or group D cell walls produced only an acute necrotoxic reaction.<Animals, Antibodies, Antigens, metabolism, Autoradiography, Cell Wall, metabolism, Iodine Isotopes, Lymph Nodes, metabolism, Mice, Mucoproteins, metabolism, Muramidase, metabolism, Polysaccharides, Bacterial, metabolism, Rabbits, Skin, metabolism, Skin Diseases, chemically induced, Streptococcus
16057794<Development of immune tolerance in the chick embryo to Borrelia hispanica.<Varying degrees of immune tolerance were induced in chick embryos at 10, 14, and 18 days of age by inoculation of living or dead Borrelia hispanica in the yolk sac, allantoic cavity, or intravenously. Relative tolerance was measured by responses to challenge with virulent organisms in relation to altered susceptibility to infection and inability to produce agglutinins for B. hispanica or Proteus strain OXK. Challenges were made 1 week posthatching with the controls and chicks that had received dead organisms embryonically, and all chicks and controls were challenged at 5-week intervals from the 5th through the 30th week posthatching. Infections persisted 7 to 12 days in the tolerant chicks without a recurring parasitemia. Control chicks were never infected, and in almost all instances produced agglutinins. Differences in degree and duration of tolerance were observed in relation to the age of the embryo injected and may, or may not, have been related to differences of antigenic mass. Differences in induced tolerance were also observed in the three inoculation routes (intravenous &gt; allantoic cavity &gt; yolk sac, with the first route as the greatest) with chicks that had received dead organisms embryonically, but not with those that had received living organisms. Tolerance was not transmitted to the progeny of tolerant pullets.<Agglutination Tests, Aging, Animals, Antibody Formation, Borrelia Infections, immunology, Chick Embryo, immunology, Immune Tolerance, Proteus Infections, immunology
16057795<Lipopolysaccharides of Salmonella T mutants.<The composition of lipopolysaccharides derived from various Salmonella T forms was studied. All T1-form lipopolysaccharides examined contained 14 to 22% each of both d-galactose and pentose in addition to 4 to 9% each of ketodeoxyoctonic acid, heptose, d-glucosamine, and d-glucose. The pentose was identified as d-ribose. The T2-form lipopolysaccharide examined did not contain a significant amount of pentose, nor more than the usual amounts of d-galactose. Periodate oxidation of T1 (lipo) polysaccharides followed by NaBH(4) reduction revealed that ribose was almost quantitatively protected, galactose was destroyed, and threitol and mannose were newly formed. The latter two products probably originated from 4-linked galactose and heptose, respectively. Ribose and galactose were found in specific precipitates of T1 lipopolysaccharide with anti-T1 antiserum but were not found in specific precipitates of alkali-treated T1 lipopolysaccharide and of Freeman degraded polysaccharide with anti-T1 serum Ribose and galactose are present in these degraded preparations in the form of nondialyzable polymers. The T1-form mutant lipopolysaccharides lacked the O-specific sugars constituting the side-chains in the wild-type antigens. They did not produce the soluble O-specific haptenic polysaccharide known to be accumulated in RI strains. With these properties, T1 lipopolysaccharides resemble RII lipopolysaccharides. Like RII degraded polysaccharides, T1-degraded polysaccharides also contained glucosamine. Furthermore, strong cross-reactions were found to exist between T1 and RII lipopolysaccharides in both hemagglutination inhibition assays and in precipitation tests. It is proposed that T1 lipopolysaccharides represent RII lipopolysaccharides to which polymers consisting of ribose and galactose are attached.<Carbohydrates, Fucose, analysis, Galactose, analysis, Glucosamine, analysis, Glucose, analysis, Hemagglutination Inhibition Tests, Heptoses, analysis, Hexosamines, analysis, Immune Sera, Keto Acids, analysis, Lipopolysaccharides, analysis, Mannose, Mutation, Oxidation-Reduction, Phosphotransferases, metabolism, Polysaccharides, Bacterial, analysis, Precipitin Tests, Ribose, analysis, metabolism, Salmonella, analysis
16057796<Cell walls of group D streptococci. II. Chemical studies on the type 1 antigen purified from the autolytic digest of cell walls.<Autolysis of group D, type I cell walls by an indigenous autolytic enzyme results in the solubilization of the type I antigen. The antigen was purified from the autolytic digest by diethylaminoethyl cellulose chromatography. Chemical analysis of the purified type 1 antigen revealed glucose, glucosamine, galactosamine, rhamnose, ribitol, phosphorus, and residual peptoglycan components. This analysis suggested that the type I antigen is a heteropolymer which may contain a ribitol teichoic acid. The antigen purified by the procedure outlined here is higher in phosphorus content, lower in peptidoglycan, and more reactive serologically than the antigen prepared by methods previously described.<Alanine, analysis, Ammonia, analysis, Antigens, analysis, Bacteriolysis, Cell Wall, Chromatography, Gas, Chromatography, Gel, Chromatography, Ion Exchange, Electrophoresis, Glucosamine, analysis, Glucose, analysis, Glutamates, analysis, Hexosamines, analysis, Lysine, analysis, Organophosphonates, analysis, Phosphorus, analysis, Precipitin Tests, Rhamnose, analysis, Ribose, analysis, Streptococcus, Ultracentrifugation
16057797<Experimental irradiated arthrospore vaccine against coccidioidomycosis in mice.<An experimental irradiated ((60)Co) arthrospore vaccine against coccidioidomycosis protected approximately 75% of mice from death after an intraperitoneal challenge sufficient to kill approximately 90% of the nonimmunized control mice. Although the majority of the immunized mice became infected with Coccidioides immitis, the histologic lesions were substantially less severe than those in the nonimmunized controls, particularly in the pulmonary region. Although arthrospores irradiated with 1, 2, or 3 million roentgens lost their ability to multiply in various laboratory media (probably through interference with cell division), partial conversion to the parasitic phase (spherule) was observed after animal inoculation (rounding out of arthrospores into immature spherules, but without development of endospores).

16057798<Serological comparison of spherules and arthrospores of Coccidioides immitis.<Spherule and arthrospore cellular preparations were sonic-treated and separated into their respective supernatant and sediment components. Complement-fixation tests with antispherule and antiarthrospore pooled rabbit sera revealed that the soluble antigens exhibited more serological activity than the sediment preparations. After autoclaving, an arthrospore cellular antigen exhibited increased activity with either antisera, whereas autoclaved spherules exhibited increased activity only with antispherule serum. Complement-fixation tests with coccicioidin and spherule culture supernatant preparations revealed quantitative or qualitative differences in antigenic determinants between these two morphological phases of Coccidioides immitis.<Antigen-Antibody Reactions, Antigens, Blastomyces, Candida, Coccidioides, immunology, Complement Fixation Tests, Histoplasma, Hot Temperature, Immune Sera, Spores, Toxins, Biological
16057799<Physiochemical properties of the Vi antigen before and after mild alkaline hydrolysis.<Sedimentation and diffusion constants were determined for electrophoretically purified Vi antigen before and after mild alkaline hydrolysis. The molecular weight of the intact antigen was found to be 1.7 x 10(6). Mild alkaline hydrolysis completely removed O-acetyl, reduced the molecular weight to 1.0 x 10(5), and lowered the intrinsic viscosity from 8.0 deciliters/g to approximately 0.5 deciliter/g.

16057800<Inhibitio of flagellar coordination in Spirillum volutans.<The motility of Spirillum volutans is caused by the rotation of each polar flagellar fascicle in a direction opposite to that of the more slowly rotating cell. Both flagella form cones of revolution oriented in the same direction. When the cell reverses its motion, both fascicles simultaneously reverse their rotation and also the orientation of their cones of revolution, with the tail fascicle becoming the head and vice versa. Chloral hydrate and phenol were found to cause uncoordination, with both fascicles becoming the head type; MgSO(4), Mg(NO(3))(2), NiSO(4), NiCl(2), CuSO(4), and CuCl(2) also caused uncoordination, with both fascicles becoming the tail type. In all cases, the flagellar fascicles remained highly active but the cells were motionless because of the opposing propulsion; the rotation of the fascicles was in a constant direction without reversal. Uncoordinated states could be maintained for 30 to 60 min. Neutralization of the dual-tail flagellation caused by NiSO(4) could be accomplished with chloral hydrate. At the null point, the flagellar orientation was intermediate between head and tail; the fascicles continually reversed direction of rotation, and, now coordinated, caused the cells to move back and forth. Higher concentrations of chloral hydrate completely overcame the effect of NiSO(4) and caused dual-head flagellation. Optimal concentrations of test compounds were determined with the use of pure cultures and a reproducible growth medium.<Chloral Hydrate, pharmacology, Chlorides, pharmacology, Copper, pharmacology, Drug Antagonism, Flagella, drug effects, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Magnesium Sulfate, pharmacology, Motion Pictures, Movement, drug effects, Nickel, pharmacology, Nitrates, pharmacology, Phenols, pharmacology, Rotation, Spirillum, drug effects, growth &amp; development, Sulfates, pharmacology
16057801<Synchrony of nuclear replication in individual hyphae of Aspergillus nidulans.<The synchrony of nuclear replication in individual, multinucleate hyphae of Aspergillus nidulans has been investigated. Samples were taken from cultures of germinating conidiospores, and the relative frequency of hyphae containing two to eight nuclei was determined. Because the conidiospores are mononucleate, complete synchrony will yield populations of hyphae containing only 2(n) nuclei, n being the number of doublings after germination. The appearance of hyphae with total numbers of nuclei other than 2(n) will indicate lack of synchrony. The relative frequency of hyphae not having 2(n) nuclei will depend on the degree of synchrony in the individual hyphae; numerical aspects of this relation are discussed. In two different strains, replication of the nuclei in any one hypha was highly synchronized when the dry weight doubling time was 1.4 to 1.8 hr. As the doubling time was made longer by changing the nitrogen or carbon source, synchrony was progressively lost. At the slowest growth rate tested, the interval between the division of the fastest and the slowest nucleus equaled 48% of the dry weight doubling time. The active replication of some nuclei in a hypha where other nuclei were resting suggested that nuclear duplication in this eukaryotic organism may be controlled by specific initiators.<Arabinose, metabolism, Aspergillus, growth &amp; development, Cell Division, Culture Media, Glucose, metabolism, Histidine, metabolism, Kinetics, Nitrates, metabolism, Spores, growth &amp; development, Tryptophan, metabolism, Xylose, metabolism
16057803<Cryptococcus neoformans. I. Nonencapsulated mutants.<Seven nonencapsulated mutants of Cryptococcus neoformans were isolated from an encapsulated strain of human origin. Initially, the mutants were avirulent for mice. After several months of subculturing, six of the seven isolates reverted to the encapsulated state and possessed varying degrees of virulence. The results of these experiments suggest that a strong correlation exists between the presence of a capsule and the virulence of C. neoformans.<Animals, Carbohydrate Metabolism, Chromatography, Paper, Cryptococcus, analysis, growth &amp; development, metabolism, pathogenicity, radiation effects, Galactose, analysis, Glucuronates, analysis, Humans, Mannose, analysis, Meningitis, microbiology, Mice, Mutation, radiation effects, Nitrates, metabolism, Radiation Effects, Urease, metabolism, Virulence, Xylose, analysis
16057802<Enhancement of Agrobacterium tumefaciens infectivity by mitomycin C.<The ability of Agrobacterium tumefaciens to induce pinto leaf tumors may be enhanced two- to threefold after treatment with mitomycin C. The enhancement may be obtained with either lethal or nonlethal concentrations. With 10-min treatments, an optimal response was obtained with 0.005 mug of mitomycin C per ml in the absence of any change in the number of viable cells. Both the tumor induction process and the tumors induced by treated cultures appear qualitatively the same as controls. To account for these results, the antibiotic must increase the proportion of viable cells that will subsequently initiate tumors. One, or at most a few, random lesions in the bacterial chromosome seem to be the necessary requirement for this promotion. At mitomycin concentrations of 1 and 5 mug/ml, the ability of A. tumefaciens to initiate tumors is rapidly lost, indicating that a fairly intact bacterial chromosome is one of the essentials for the tumor induction process.<Chromosomes, Bacterial, drug effects, DNA, Bacterial, pharmacology, Mitomycins, pharmacology, Plant Tumors, Rhizobium, drug effects, pathogenicity
16057804<Catabolite repression in the facultative chemoautotroph Thiobacillus novellus.<Several fermentable carbon sources were found to give rise to catabolite repression of all enzymes implicated in thiosulfate oxidation in the facultative chemoautotroph, Thiobacillus novellus. Glucose was found to elicit a strong repression. Glycerol, lactate, lactose, ribose, and pyruvate caused marked repression. In all cases, the repression could be relieved only by returning the cells to a medium devoid of such fermentable substrates. On the other hand, carbon compounds (amino acids and organic acids) that are metabolizable only aerobically caused transient or no repression of the thiosulfate oxidative system. All of the enzymes believed to participate in thiosulfate oxidation, except tetrathionase, were found to be simultaneously induced and repressed. This would suggest that tetrathionate may not be a necessary intermediate in the thiosulfate-oxidation pathway of T. novellus.<Cell-Free System, Citrates, pharmacology, Culture Media, Glucose, pharmacology, Glutamates, pharmacology, Glycerol, pharmacology, Lactates, pharmacology, Lactose, pharmacology, Oxidation-Reduction, Oxidoreductases, metabolism, Oxygen, pharmacology, Pyruvates, pharmacology, Ribose, pharmacology, Succinates, pharmacology, Sulfites, metabolism, Sulfur, metabolism, Thiobacillus, enzymology, growth &amp; development, Thiosulfates, metabolism, Transferases, metabolism
16057805<Carbohydrate metabolism in streptomycetes. II. Isolation and enzymatic synthesis of trehalose.<A number of streptomycetes were examined for their ability to synthesize trehalose phosphate as well as for the presence of alpha,alpha-trehalose. In each case, an enzyme system was demonstrated which catalyzed the transfer of glucose from guanosine diphosphate-glucose to glucose-6-phosphate to form trehalose phosphate. Thus, this group of organisms appears to synthesize trehalose phosphate by a different mechanism from that described in insects, yeast, and fungi. In addition, trehalose was isolated from each of these organisms. In several of these cases, crystallization of the sugar and determination of the physical properties showed that the sugar was alpha,alpha-trehalose.<Chromatography, Paper, Crystallization, Disaccharides, biosynthesis, Glucose, metabolism, Guanine Nucleotides, metabolism, Hexosephosphates, metabolism, Phosphates, Phosphotransferases, metabolism, Streptomyces, enzymology, metabolism
16057806<Dominant mutation for ethionine resistance in Saccharomyces cerevisae.<An ethionine-resistant mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been investigated whose mutation (et(r2)) confers resistance to the heterozygous diploid also containing the sensitive allele, et(s). The mutation is apparently specific for reversal of ethionine inhibition. The principal difference between the sensitive et(s) strain and the mutant was the latter's inability to concentrate large intracellular quantities of adenosylethionine. Reduced incorporation of ethyl groups or ethionine in other cellular fractions of the mutant was also detected. The data show that the mutant has not lost the ability to form adenosylethionine. It is suggested that the mutant has an increased ability to hydrolyze this sulfonium compound after it has been synthesized. It is possible that some of the ethionine is detoxified before it can participate in protein or adenosylethionine synthesis. No mutant alteration in accumulation of ethionine from the medium was detected. In the presence of ethionine, the parental strain accumulated 25 times more adenosylethionine than did the mutant. However, with methionine, only twice as much adenosylmethionine was accumulated by the parental strain as by the mutant.<Carbon Isotopes, Chromatography, Paper, Culture Media, Drug Resistance, Microbial, Ethionine, metabolism, pharmacology, Fluorine, Genes, Dominant, Methionine, metabolism, Mutation, Nucleosides, biosynthesis, Phenylalanine, pharmacology, Saccharomyces, Sulfones, metabolism, Tritium
16057807<Formation of alpha-hydroxyglutaric acid by Aspergillus glaucus.<Aspergillus glaucus, cultured on sodium propionate-mineral salts medium, incorporates (14)C-glyoxylate into labeled alpha-hydroxyglutaric acid within 30 sec. Mycelial extracts retain this biosynthetic capacity, which is destroyed by heating. Propionyl-2-(14)C-coenzyme A also in incorporated into labeled alpha-hydroxyglutaric acid by these mycelial extracts, but to a more limited extent. (14)CO(2) evolution studies, employing differentially labeled (14)C-propionate, indicate C-1 is oxidized by the mold before C-2, and C-2 before C-3. These findings suggest the involvement of alpha-hydroxyglutaric acid in the catabolism of propionic acid by A. glaucus.<Aspergillus, metabolism, Carbon Dioxide, biosynthesis, Carbon Isotopes, Cell-Free System, Coenzyme A, metabolism, Culture Media, Fumarates, biosynthesis, Glutarates, biosynthesis, Glycolates, biosynthesis, Glyoxylates, metabolism, Hot Temperature, Malates, biosynthesis, Propionates, metabolism, Salts, metabolism, Succinates, biosynthesis
16057808<Role of a cell-wall glucan-degrading enzyme in mating of Schizophyllum commune.<Mycelial enzyme extracts of Schizophyllum commune were prepared during vegetative growth matings leading to common-A and common-B heterokaryons and the dikaryon, and were examined for hydrolytic activity against an alkaliinsoluble cell-wall glucan (R-glucan) isolated from this mushroom. In extracts from several individual homokaryotic mycelia the R-glucanase activity was low and did not increase when the cultures exhausted glucose in the medium. In common-A matings, a 30-fold increase in specific activity of intracellular R-glucanase was found even in the presence of glucose in the broth. An increase of this magnitude was not observed in the common-B mating nor in the fully compatible cross leading to the dikaryon. Extracts of the dikaryon did show elevated R-glucanase activity after exogenous glucose disappearance and subsequent fruiting. In none of these situations was an enzyme activity detected towards an alkali-soluble cell-wall glucan (S-glucan) prepared from S. commune. Changes in R-glucanase were not parallelled by identical changes in laminarinase, pustulanase, cellobiase, and p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-glucosidase, but comparable increases in specific activities were found for hydrolysis of glycogen and maltose. After interaction of the various mycelia in mating combinations, the S-glucan/R-glucan ratio of the cell wall of the dikaryon was found to be similar to that of the homokaryons, but increased in the common-B interaction and was elevated almost threefold in the common-A heterokaryon.<Basidiomycota, analysis, cytology, enzymology, growth &amp; development, Cell Wall, enzymology, Glucose, analysis, metabolism, pharmacology, Glucosidases, metabolism, Glycogen, metabolism, Glycoside Hydrolases, metabolism, Maltose, metabolism, Molecular Biology, Polysaccharides, analysis, metabolism
16057809<Multiple alterations in metabolite uptake in a mutant of Neurospora crassa.<A temperature-conditional lethal mutant of Neurospora crassa, un-t (55701), was resistant to neutral amino acid analogues by virtue of a decreased ability to transport these analogues and their natural congeners across the cell membrane. The uptake of acidic, but not basic, amino acids was also impaired, as was the uptake of potassium ions. After preincubation above the tolerated temperature, the ability to take up a still wider variety of metabolites was greatly reduced. Protoplasts of the mutant were more osmotically fragile than those of wild type.

16057810<Inducible synthesis of bacterial luciferase: specificity and kinetics of induction.<A nitrate-utilizing strain of marine bacteria was isolated in which luciferase was inducible by l-arginine. The induction was highly specific; structural analogues of arginine were ineffective, as were other natural amino acids. Several metabolites of arginine acted as weak inducers but did not affect the rate of induction in limiting concentrations of arginine. Hence, these compounds probably exerted a sparing effect on intracellular arginine. The kinetics of induction were followed by measurement of light output from intact cells, under conditions in which in vivo light output was determined only by the luciferase level. No enzyme appeared in the cells for 12 min after the addition of inducer, although the primary structure of the luciferase molecule was apparently synthesized within 2 to 4 min. It is proposed that during the remaining 8 to 10 min a precursor of luciferase was converted to active enzyme. The differential rate of synthesis rose during the first 5 min of induction, apparently as messenger ribonucleic acid accumulates in the cells; thereafter it remained constant for approximately 100 min.<Amines, pharmacology, Amino Acids, pharmacology, Ammonium Chloride, pharmacology, Arginine, pharmacology, Azo Compounds, pharmacology, Bacteria, enzymology, Bacterial Proteins, biosynthesis, Carbamates, pharmacology, Carbon Isotopes, Chloramphenicol, pharmacology, Enzyme Induction, drug effects, Fluorine, Fluorouracil, pharmacology, Guanidines, pharmacology, Kinetics, Light, Luciferases, biosynthesis, Marine Biology, Nitrates, metabolism, Phenylalanine, pharmacology, Propylamines, pharmacology, Puromycin, pharmacology, RNA, Messenger, biosynthesis, Urea, pharmacology
16057811<Cytochrome synthesis and its regulation in Spirillum itersonii.<Spirillum itersonii contains b- and c-type cytochromes as well as a carbon monoxide-binding pigment of the cytochrome o type. Synthesis of cytochromes b and c is increased by about two- and fourfold, respectively, when cells are transferred from high to low aeration. The increased concentration of cytochrome is not accompanied by an increase in the respiration rate of the cells. Both cytochrome b and cytochrome c are located in the particulate fraction of cells grown under high or low aeration, and both pigments are fully reducible by succinate. No evidence was found for the accumulation of the protein component of either cytochrome when synthesis of the prosthetic group was limited by iron deficiency, nor did heme or precursors accumulate when protein synthesis was prevented. It was therefore concluded that the formation of the heme prosthetic group is closely integrated with the synthesis of the protein moiety. delta-Aminolevulinate synthase was detected in extracts of the organism. Its activity was correlated with cytochrome synthesis; it was reduced by high aeration and increased under low aeration. The synthase was inhibited by hemin at concentrations of 10 mum or higher. The observations are consistent with a central role for the heme prosthetic group in the regulation of cytochrome synthesis.<Bacterial Proteins, biosynthesis, Carbon Monoxide, Chloramphenicol, pharmacology, Culture Media, Cytochromes, biosynthesis, metabolism, Electron Transport, Heme, biosynthesis, pharmacology, Iron, pharmacology, Lyases, metabolism, Nitrates, pharmacology, Oxygen, pharmacology, Oxygen Consumption, Pigments, Biological, Spectrum Analysis, Spirillum, enzymology, metabolism, Succinates, metabolism
16057812<Ultrastructure and birefringence of the isolated mitotic apparatus of marine eggs.<Isolated mitotic apparatuses (MA) of clam and sea urchin eggs were investigated by polarizing and electron microscopy. Examination of fixed MA in oils of different refractive index revealed that at least 90% of the retardation of isolated MA is due to positive, form birefringence, the remaining retardation deriving from positive, intrinsic birefringence. Electron micrographs reveal the isolated MA to be composed of microtubules, ribosome-like particles, and a variety of vesicles. In the clam MA the number of vesicles and ribosome-like particles relative to the number of microtubules is much lower than in the sea urchin MA. In clam MA this allows form and intrinsic birefringence to be related directly to microtubules. The relation of birefringence to microtubules in isolated sea urchin MA is more complex since ribosome-like particles adhere to microtubules, are oriented by them, and are likely to contribute to the form birefringence of the isolated MA. However, comparison of values of retardation for clam and sea urchin MA, indicates that the major part of the birefringence in sea urchin MA is also due to microtubules. The interpretation of the structures giving rise to birefringence in the MA of the living cells is likely to be even more complex since masking substances, compression, or tension on the living MA may alter the magnitude or sign of the birefringence.<Animals, Birefringence, Echinodermata, physiology, Microscopy, Electron, Microscopy, Polarization, Mitosis, Mollusca, physiology

In contrast, the large alveolar epithelial cells (type II, granular pneumonocyte) are active phagocytic cells. It is proposed that the Clara cell is the main source of pulmonary phospholipid production (presumably surfactant) while the large alveolar cell is responsible for its subsequent breakdown.<Aerosols, pharmacology, Animals, Autoradiography, Bronchi, cytology, Carbon, pharmacology, Cilia, Epithelium, metabolism, Mice, Phagocytosis, drug effects, Phospholipids, metabolism, Pulmonary Alveoli, cytology, Surface-Active Agents, metabolism
16058007<Hormone-dependent differentiation of immature mouse mammary gland in vitro.<Explants from the mammary glands of 3-week-old mice can be induced to synthesize casein in vitro in the absence of lobuloalveolar development. Maximum biochemical differentiation requires the presence of insulin, hydrocortisone, and prolactin in the culture medium. In contrast to explants from adult mice, the mammary epithelium of immature animals undergoes DNA synthesis and mitosis in vitro in the absence of exogenous insulin; however, such proliferation does not lead to the formation of differentiated daughter cells. Insulin acts in at least two ways during the proliferative phases of the cell cycle of differentiating mammary epithelial cells.<Aging, Animals, Caseins, biosynthesis, Cell Differentiation, drug effects, Culture Techniques, DNA, biosynthesis, Female, Hormones, pharmacology, Hydrocortisone, pharmacology, Insulin, pharmacology, Mammary Glands, Animal, cytology, metabolism, Mice, Mitosis, Prolactin, pharmacology

Embryonic and adult methionyl transfer RNA's showed qualitative and quantitative differences in both chromatographic systems. The patterns for arginyl, seryl, and tyrosyl transfer RNA's in the two cell types were similar, while the leucyl transfer RNA patterns suggested a difference.<Animals, Arginine, analysis, Carbon Isotopes, Chick Embryo, Chickens, growth &amp; development, Chromatography, Ion Exchange, Erythrocytes, analysis, Leucine, analysis, Methionine, analysis, RNA, Transfer, blood, Reticulocytes, analysis, Serine, analysis, Tyrosine, analysis
16058009<A mutagenic effect of visible light mediated by endogenous pigments in Euglena gracilis.<Mutant cells lackng chlorophyll, chloroplasts, and chloroplast DNA were produced by irradiating Euglena gracilis in aerobic conditions with visible or red light (greater than 610 nanometers) of an intensity equivalent to that of direct sunlight. The photosensitizer is apparently the endogenous chlorophyll present in the chloroplasts. These mutants are comparable to those induced by ultraviolet light, x-rays, heat, or streptomycin. Our findings indicate that visible light can serve as a mutagenic agent in the absence of exogenous photosensitizers, thus directly effecting the course of evolution of organisms containing chlorophyll.<Animals, Biological Evolution, Centrifugation, Density Gradient, Cesium, Chlorophyll, DNA, analysis, Euglena, Light, Mutation, Pigments, Biological, Sunlight
16058010<Neurons in paradoxical sleep and motivated behavior.<Single-cell recordings were taken with electrodes permanently implanted in unrestrained rats during normal sleep, paradoxical sleep, quiet awake, and highly motivated awake periods. In most areas, neuronal activity increased when normal sleep changed to paradoxical sleep. The hypothalamus showed a significantly greater increase than most other areas. The hippocampus differed strikingly from all other areas by showing a decrement in all cases. The average firing rates in paradoxical sleep exceeded those of the quiet awake state as well as those of normal sleep. Comparison of paradoxical sleep with motivated behavior illustrated that changes in brain activity during paradoxical sleep were related to anatomically specifiable groupings, but no such differentiation appeared in motivated behavior.<Animals, Behavior, Animal, Dreams, Electroencephalography, Hippocampus, physiology, Hypothalamus, physiology, Male, Motivation, Neurons, physiology, Rats, Sleep, physiology, Wakefulness

16058110<Lysosomal acid proteinase of rabbit liver.<1. Acid proteinase from rabbit liver lysosomes was purified about 1000-fold, on a protein basis. 2. The purification procedure involved isolation of a lysosomal-mitochondrial pellet and conversion of this into an acetone-dried powder. 3. The enzyme was extracted with an acidic buffer and subjected to column chromatography with DEAE-Sephadex and Sephadex G-100. 4. The molecular weight of the enzyme was 50000-52000. 5. Maximal activity against haemoglobin was obtained at pH3.2; serum albumin was attacked, but very much more slowly. 6. Several possible inhibitors of the enzyme were tested. Thiol-blocking reagents, several inhibitors of trypsin and chymotrypsin, and a chelating agent were without effect. 7. The enzyme was competitively inhibited by 3-phenylpyruvic acid at low concentrations. 8. Dithiothreitol caused rapid inactivation of the enzyme at pH8. 9. It is concluded that this enzyme is a form of cathepsin D, which may be widely distributed in lysosomes.<Animals, Cathepsins, analysis, antagonists &amp; inhibitors, Chromatography, Electrophoresis, Hemoglobins, antagonists &amp; inhibitors, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Kinetics, Liver, cytology, Lysosomes, enzymology, Mitochondria, analysis, Molecular Weight, Rabbits, Serum Albumin, Bovine, antagonists &amp; inhibitors

A method was developed for the analysis of ubiquinone in animal tissues and the recovery of added ubiquinone tested in liver of the rat, Crocodylus porosus and Squalus acanthias. 2. The ubiquinone content of heart, liver and gut (or breast muscle in birds) was measured in 67 different animal species, selected to be representative of all the vertebrate classes. 3. The suggestion is advanced that the possession of appreciable amounts of endogenous tissue ubiquinone is usually characteristic of evolutionarily advanced vertebrates, and the biological and biochemical significance of the results is discussed.<Animals, Biological Evolution, Intestines, analysis, Liver, analysis, Methods, Muscles, analysis, Myocardium, analysis, Rats, Ubiquinone, analysis, Vertebrates

A method for the purification of the nicotinamide nucleotide-independent alcohol dehydrogenase of Pseudomonas sp. M27 is described. 2. In the analytical ultracentrifuge, the purified enzyme shows a single major component of molecular weight 146000. 3. On electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels between pH5.0 and 9.55, it shows only one protein band and the isoelectric point appears to be between pH7.0 and 8.0. 4. Spectrographic analysis indicates no significant metal content. 5. Amino acid analysis shows an unusually small number of cysteine/cystine residues per molecule as well as about 4.1% of glucosamine. 6.

16058137<The application of electromagnetic theory to electrocardiology. II. Numerical solution of the integral equations.<In an earlier paper exact integral equations were derived for the surface potentials resulting from sources within an irregularly shaped inhomogeneous body. These exact equations cannot usually be solved. In this paper a discrete analogue is constructed which is not straightforward to solve, but which can be treated by careful mathematical methods. In particular a deflation procedure greatly facilitates the iterative solution of the problem and overcomes the divergence encountered by other authors. Numerical solutions obtained for simple geometries are compared to the exact analytic solutions available in such cases. The necessary convergence of the solutions of the discrete analog towards the solution of the continuous problem is shown to occur only if the coefficients of the discrete analogue are carefully evaluated. Calculations are then presented for realistic thoracic geometries, typical results being presented as surface potential maps. Finally the important effect of the internal regional inhomogeneities, particularly a realistic cardiac blood mass, is demonstrated by obtaining vector loops with and without these effects.<Biophysical Phenomena, Biophysics, Electrocardiography, Heart, Humans, Mathematics, Models, Theoretical, Thorax, Vectorcardiography
16058221<Effects of chronic excess salt ingestion. Genetic influence on the development of salt hypertension in parabiotic rats: evidence for a humoral factor.<Parabiosis has been found to modify the expected blood pressure response of rats from two strains with opposite genetic propensities for experimental hypertension. When a member from one strain was united in parabiosis with a member from the other and both were maintained on high NaCl diet, the rat from the strain ordinarily resistant to it rapidly developed hypertension, in contrast to appropriate controls from this strain. The development of hypertension in this resistant animal preceded that in its mate from the strain highly sensitive to hypertension. In the latter, both the level of hypertension and mortality were significantly less than in its control. It seems likely that the hypertension observed is the resistant parabiont was initiated in its partner from the sensitive strain. This modification in blood pressures was not observed in the absence of a high NaCl diet. Parabiosis between animals from the same strain did not alter their response. Thus, as in earlier experiences (1-4) the interaction of a nongenetic factor (NaCl) with the appropriate genetic substrate appeared to be necessary for the development of hypertension. The findings are interpreted as evidence that a transmittable humoral influence plays an important role in the pathogenesis of rat hypertension. The presence of this agent is genetically determined but, under the conditions of these experiments, it took the added stimulus of dietary NaCl to demonstrate its existence.<Animals, Blood Pressure Determination, Body Fluids, Diet, Genetics, Hypertension, chemically induced, metabolism, Parabiosis, Rats, Sodium Chloride
16058222<Cell motility by labile association of molecules. The nature of mitotic spindle fibers and their role in chromosome movement.<This article summarizes our current views on the dynamic structure of the mitotic spindle and its relation to mitotic chromosome movements. The following statements are based on measurements of birefringence of spindle fibers in living cells, normally developing or experimentally modified by various physical and chemical agents, including high and low temperatures, antimitotic drugs, heavy water, and ultraviolet microbeam irradiation. Data were also obtained concomitantly with electron microscopy employing a new fixative and through measurements of isolated spindle protein. Spindle fibers in living cells are labile dynamic structures whose constituent filaments (microtubules) undergo cyclic breakdown and reformation. The dynamic state is maintained by an equilibrium between a pool of protein molecules and their linearly aggregated polymers, which constitute the microtubules or filaments. In living cells under physiological conditions, the association of the molecules into polymers is very weak (absolute value of DeltaF(25 degrees C) &lt; 1 kcal), and the equilibrium is readily shifted to dissociation by low temperature or by high hydrostatic pressure. The equilibrium is shifted toward formation of polymer by increase in temperature (with a large increase in entropy: DeltaS(25 degrees C) approximately 100 eu) or by the addition of heavy water. The spindle proteins tend to polymerize with orienting centers as their geometrical foci. The centrioles, kinetochores, and cell plate act as orienting centers successively during mitosis. Filaments are more concentrated adjacent to an orienting center and yield higher birefringence. Astral rays, continuous fibers, chromosomal fibers, and phragmoplast fibers are thus formed by successive reorganization of the same protein molecules. During late prophase and metaphase, polymerization takes place predominantly at the kinetochores; in metaphase and anaphase, depolymerization is prevalent near the spindle poles. When the concentration of spindle protein is high, fusiform bundles of polymer are precipitated out even in the absence of obvious orienting centers. The shift of equilibrium from free protein molecules to polymer increases the length and number of the spindle microtubules or filaments. Slow depolymerization of the polymers, which can be brought about by low concentrations of colchicine or by gradual cooling, allows the filaments to shorten and perform work. The dynamic equilibrium controlled by orienting centers and other factors provides a plasusible mechanism by which chromosomes and other organelles, as well as the cell surface, are deformed or moved by temporarily organized arrays of microtubules or filaments.<Birefringence, Chromosomes, Microscopy, Electron, Mitosis, physiology, Models, Biological, Models, Structural, Organoids, physiology, Proteins, Temperature, Ultracentrifugation, Ultraviolet Rays
16058237<Impulse frequency in secretory nerves of salivary glands.<1. In dogs under pentothal anaesthesia the submaxillary duct was exposed in the neck and a polythene tube tied into it. During the following days the dogs were examined repeatedly, standing in a frame. The highest rates of submaxillary secretion evoked by introducing various foodstuffs or rejectable substances into the mouth were estimated. Finally, the dogs were anaesthetized and the rates of salivary flow recorded during electrical stimulation of the chordalingual nerve at different frequencies.2. The frequency-response curve for electrical stimulation has a steep slope up to a frequency of 10/sec, where a salivary flow at a rate of about 90% of the maximal is evoked.3. The fastest secretion that is obtained reflexly on feeding corresponds to a flow which in different experiments varies between 4 and 8 shocks/sec. The very rapid secretion caused by rejectable substances can be reproduced by stimulating at 10-30/sec.4. In similar experiments on the parotid gland foodstuffs were often, and rejectable substances always found to cause a salivary flow at a rate which exceeded that obtained on maximal stimulation of the auriculotemporal nerve. This supports the view expressed by previous investigators that additional secretory fibres reach the parotid gland of the dog by anatomically unknown routes.<Animals, Dogs, Electric Stimulation, Neurons, physiology, Parotid Gland, metabolism, Salivary Glands, metabolism, Submandibular Gland, innervation, metabolism, physiology
16058243<The effect of thyrocalcitonin on blood-bone calcium equilibrium in the perfused tibia of the cat.<1. In the isolated tibia of the cat, perfused with blood from its own carotid connected to popliteal artery via a pump, infusion of porcine thyrocalcitonin causes an arteriovenous difference in calcium concentration of up to 5%, corresponding to net retention of calcium in bone.2. When taken in conjunction with determinations of radiocalcium clearance in the tibia, the effect is of the right order of magnitude to account for the hypocalcaemic action of thyrocalcitonin in the whole animal.3. Calcium retention was accompanied by a small increase in acidity of outflowing venous blood whereas verification of the hypothesis of calcium regulation by pH change in the bone substance would require a decrease.<Animals, Bone and Bones, metabolism, Calcitonin, pharmacology, Calcium, blood, metabolism, Cats, Tibia

The density of the agent is similar to known murine leukemia virus (1.15 to 1.17 grams per cubic centimeter). In the electron microscope the virus showed typical "C"-type particle morphology with various maturation stages. The maximum diameter of the mature viral particles in plasma was 115 millimicrons, a diameter slightly larger than budding particles observed in tissue.

16058494<Studies on the mode of action of diphtheria toxin. II. Protein synthesis in primary heart cell cultures.<Primary heart cell cultures of embryonic guinea pigs and the neonatal rat were established and incubated with purified diphtheria toxin. The rat heart cell cultures were refractory to the effects of the toxin; protein synthesis proceeded normally as measured by the incorporation of tritiated leucine into cell proteins; beating heart cells continued to contract; and the cell monolayers remained intact after exposure to the toxin for periods as long as 72 hr. These findings are compatible with the species resistance of the rat to diphtheria toxin. The guinea pig heart cell cultures were found to be extremely sensitive to the toxin. Protein synthesis was inhibited by approximately 50% after incubation with small quantities of toxin for 3 hr. Increasing the concentration of the length of exposure to the toxin did not increase this inhibition significantly. In addition, diphtheria toxin exerted a true cytopathic effect on the guinea pig heart cells. Monolayers were destroyed when incubated with the toxin for 2 to 3 days. The results show that the heart cells reflect species resistance or sensitivity to diphtheria toxin in the absence of neural or endocrine influences and suggest further that the toxin exerts a direct toxicity to muscle cells of the heart. It is not yet possible to explain in biochemical terms why the toxin seems to act specifically on cardiac tissues.<Animals, Animals, Newborn, Culture Techniques, Diphtheria Toxin, pharmacology, Embryo, Mammalian, Guinea Pigs, Leucine, biosynthesis, Myocardium, cytology, metabolism, Protein Biosynthesis, Rats, Species Specificity, Tritium
16058495<Further observations on the mechanism of reticuloendothelial blockade.<The mechanism of the reticuloendothelial "blockade" which followed injection of large quantities of chromic phosphate without exogenous stabilizing material was investigated in Wistar rats. The RE blockade observed for several hours after induction appeared related to the continuing circulation of the chromic phosphate-blockading dose, and a reduction in the size of the particles used enhanced blockade. RE blockade appeared to be particles specific and was not related to a generalized depression of RE-phagocytic cell function. Studies in isolated perfused rat livers appeared to eliminate saturation of particle-specific macrophage clones as a likely explanation of blockade, and blockade could not be explained on the basis of depletion of serum opsonins. In the system employed, it is postulated that blockade occurs when large numbers of circulating particles saturate specific macrophage cell membrane-binding sites rather than from physical stuffing of RE-phagocytic cells.<Animals, Chemotherapy, Cancer, Regional Perfusion, Chromium, administration &amp; dosage, blood, Female, Gold Colloid, Radioactive, Injections, Intra-Arterial, Liver, cytology, metabolism, Mononuclear Phagocyte System, immunology, metabolism, Opsonin Proteins, Phagocytosis, drug effects, Phosphates, administration &amp; dosage, blood, Phosphorus Isotopes, Rats

Following infusion of this solution into phlebotomized dogs, there is no methemoglobin formation, no adverse effects on vital signs, and no demonstrable activation of blood coagulation. The hemoglobin maintains its oxygen-carrying capacity and liberates oxygen into tissues. Acute and chronic effects on renal function following infusion of this preparation were also studied and no effect on clearance of urea, creatinine, or P.A.H. could be demonstrated. There was no change in urinary output and histological sections revealed no lesions attributable to hemoglobin toxicity.

Reorientation failed under complete cloud cover and after 7 days of darkness in an environmental chamber, but persisted in newts whose eyes were excised and in those displaced more than 27 kilometers in darkness.

Fungitoxicity is high with phosphinamidothionate and triarylmethyl groups as substituents.

This preparation under voltage clamp exhibits relations between current and voltage like those described for the squid axon. The early inward current component is reduced in a solution with low sodium concentration. This preparation, then, acts in all its essential features like the squid giant axon.

16058994<Local and central circulatory responses to sustained contractions and the effect of free or restricted arterial inflow on post-exercise hyperaemia.<1. The cardiovascular responses to sustained contractions at tensions from 5 to 30% maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) have been examined. At 5 and 10% MVC blood pressure, heart rate and forearm blood flow all reached a steady state during the contraction; post-exercise hyperaemia did not show peak flows higher than those found during exercise. At tensions of 20 and 30% MVC, none of the measurements showed a steady state during the contractions, but increased steadily throughout the contraction; post-exercise hyperaemia characteristically showed peak flows in excess of any flow measured during contractions. The results obtained at a tension of 15% MVC did not show a steady-state during the contraction but the following hyperaemia showed a similar pattern to that seen at the lower tensions.2. Digital compression of the brachial artery after sustained handgrip contractions for periods of 3 or 6 min after the contraction ended resulted in only a small reduction, on average by 5-15%, of the post-exercise hyperaemia.3. Consideration of the evidence leads to the view that in physiological circumstances the post-exercise hyperaemia following sustained contractions bears a close relationship to the metabolism of the active muscles.<Adult, Blood Circulation, Blood Pressure, physiology, Brachial Artery, physiology, Cardiovascular Physiological Phenomena, Forearm, blood supply, Heart Rate, physiology, Humans, Hyperemia, Male, Muscle Contraction, physiology, Muscles, blood supply, Physical Exertion, physiology, Regional Blood Flow, physiology

The cardiovascular responses to sustained hand-grip contractions at 20, 30 and 50% maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) were measured in subjects who were engaged in treadmill walking at three different rates with oxygen intakes of 1.1, 1.7 and 2.8l./min. The increments in heart rate and blood pressure at tensions of 20 and 30% MVC were similar at all rates of walking, but the response to a contraction at 50% MVC was lower at the hardest work rate than at the two easier rates.2. When two or more muscle groups contracted at the same relative tension, the increments in heart rate and blood pressure were the same, whether they contracted separately or together.3. When two or more muscle groups contracted simultaneously at different relative tensions, the increments in heart rate and blood pressure were the same as when the muscle group, at the higher relative tension, contracted separately at that tension.4. The blood flow to a muscle engaged in sustained contraction was increased when a second muscle group contracted at a higher relative tension.<Adult, Blood Circulation, physiology, Blood Pressure, physiology, Cardiovascular Physiological Phenomena, Forearm, blood supply, Heart Rate, physiology, Humans, Male, Muscle Contraction, physiology, Muscles, physiology, Physical Exertion, physiology, Regional Blood Flow, physiology
16058996<The motor innervation of the rat urinary bladder.<1. The post-ganglionic nerves visible in silver-impregnated sections of a normal rat bladder were absent 14 days after both pelvic ganglia had been ablated. After ablation of one ganglion the distribution of nerve trunks in either side of the organ was unchanged. Post-ganglionic axons from either side appear to distribute bilaterally.2. The acetylcholine (ACh) content of the rat bladder was reduced from control by 50% after the post-ganglionic nerves from one ganglion had degenerated. However, the ACh content in the two halves of the bladder sectioned along the mid line was the same after one nerve had degenerated.3. Motor responses of bladder preparations elicited during stimulation of both pelvic nerves were compared with responses elicited when each nerve was stimulated separately. In three-quarters of the animals the sum of the individual responses exceeded the response to combined nerve stimulation by no more than 20%. The functional overlap between the two groups of motor nerves to the bladder was therefore no greater than this amount in most animals.4. Motor responses of normally innervated bladder preparations elicited in vitro by transmural stimulation were compared with responses elicited after the post-ganglionic innervation from one side had degenerated. The mean response of bladders with half their innervation was 50-65% of the mean response of bladders normally innervated. The functional overlap by the two groups of nerves was found to be no greater than 15%.<Acetylcholine, analysis, Animals, Electric Stimulation, Ganglia, Autonomic, physiology, In Vitro Techniques, Male, Motor Neurons, physiology, Muscle Contraction, physiology, Muscle, Smooth, innervation, Parasympathetic Nervous System, physiology, Rats, Urinary Bladder, analysis, cytology, innervation

A study has been made of the effect of Na replacement in the incubation media on the hexose-dependent potential and the capacity of sacs of rat intestine to transfer fluid and galactose.2. Replacement of NaCl with mannitol or Tris Cl had little effect on the hexose-dependent potential, while replacement with LiCl and KCl had an inhibitory effect on the potential.3. Replacement with KCl, LiCl, mannitol and Tris Cl all reduced the capacity to transfer fluid and galactose, but the effects of Li and K replacement were greater than mannitol or Tris replacement.4. There is not a fixed relation between the magnitude of the potential and the amount of galactose transferred.<Animals, Biological Transport, Active, Chlorides, pharmacology, Electrophysiology, Galactose, pharmacology, In Vitro Techniques, Intestine, Small, physiology, Lithium, pharmacology, Mannitol, pharmacology, Potassium Chloride, pharmacology, Rats, Sodium, pharmacology
16058997<Athletes at altitude.<1. Six international middle-distance runners were investigated during 4 weeks in England and during a similar period in Mexico City (2270 m (7450 ft.))2. In 3-mile (4828 m) time trials at 2270 m the increase in time taken by four subjects compared with sea level was 8.5% on the 4th day and 5.7% on the 29th day. There was thus a gain of 2.8% or 20 sec in time associated with acclimatization.3. In 1-mile (1609 m) time trials the times were increased by 3.6% in the first week at altitude and by 1.5% in the 4th week. The improvement amounted to 2.1%, or 4.9 sec.4. In 5 min maximum exercise on the ergometer maximum O(2) intake for six subjects at altitude was reduced by 14.6% on the 2nd day and 9.5% on the 27th. Only one subject showed no change in maximum oxygen intake (V(O2, max)) with time spent at altitude.5. Although V(O2, max) was persistently reduced at altitude work rates finally exceeded sea-level values, owing to increased over-all efficiency.6. Forty-minute recovery O(2) intakes after 5 min maximum exercise averaged 17.35 l. at sea level and 17.53 l. at altitude. Mean values from 40th to 50th min were within +/- 7% of pre-exercise values.7. Serial tests at increasing loads yielded a straight-line relation between O(2) intake and work rate over a wide range of work rates at sea level and at altitude. Heart rate and ventilation for given work intensity were maximal in the first 2-10 days at altitude and thereafter declined.8. Capillary HbO(2) saturation fell from 93% at rest to 87% in maximum exercise. The corresponding alveolar gas tensions were P(A, O2) 89 mm Hg, P(A, CO2) 24 mm Hg. About half the total unsaturation in maximum exercise was explained by the Bohr effect.9. In six of eight pairs of determinations V(O2, max) measured on the ergometer was within +/- 0.15 l./min of V(O2, max) measured on the running track. Nevertheless, it was not possible to predict running performance from ergometer measurements.<Acclimatization, physiology, Adult, Altitude, Blood Pressure, physiology, Heart Rate, physiology, Humans, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Lactates, blood, Male, Oximetry, Oxygen Consumption, Physical Exertion, Respiration, physiology, Sports
16058999<The effects of alteration of CO2 and pH on intestinal blood flow in the cat.<1. The effect of alteration of arterial blood pH on intestinal blood flow in the cat has been determined under conditions of constant perfusion pressure.2. Arterial blood pH was altered over the range 7.12-7.70 by infusion of acid and alkali. When end-tidal CO(2) was held constant, there was no change in intestinal blood flow.3. When arterial blood pH was altered over the range 7.19-7.55 by the administration of CO(2) at constant respiratory volume and rate, flow increased with increasing CO(2).4. The intestinal vascular bed was less responsive to noradrenaline at pH 7.2 than at pH 7.6. The change in sensitivity was evident when end-tidal CO(2) was controlled and depended therefore on a change in hydrogenion concentration.5. The dilator effect of CO(2) did not depend upon alteration of sensitivity to noradrenaline since it was seen after adrenergic blockade.<Animals, Carbon Dioxide, analysis, pharmacology, Cats, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Intestines, blood supply, drug effects, Mesenteric Arteries, drug effects, Norepinephrine, pharmacology, Regional Blood Flow, drug effects, Sympathetic Nervous System, drug effects, Vasomotor System, drug effects
16059000<Ca-coupling in the anterior byssal retractor muscle of Mytilus edulis L.<1. Experiments designed to elucidate the role of Ca in the excitation-contraction coupling of the anterior byssus retractor muscle (ABRM) were carried out. Ca influences membrane depolarization and provides for coupling of the contraction in response to repetitive electrical stimulation as well as of ACh and KCl contracture. Depriving ABRM of Ca results in two closely correlated events: disappearance of action potential and of the contraction in response to repetitive electrical stimulation.2. A sigmoid increase in tension with the log-Ca concentration in artificial medium was observed whereas, over the same range of concentrations, the tension remnant decreased.3. Induction of relaxation by 5-HT is Ca dependent. Either thiourea inactivation or Ca deprivation results in failure to relax. Low concentrations of 5-HT (10(-7) g/ml.) bring about increase in peak tension of the contraction in response to repetitive electrical stimulation, whereas higher concentrations (10(-5) g/ml.) undermine peak tension.4. Frequencies exceeding 40 cycles evoke a contraction accompanied by tension remnant, which is eliminated with 5-HT.5. Dropwise addition of Ca on a trypsin window in the muscle induces a latency relaxation before onset of Ca-contracture.<Action Potentials, Animals, Calcium, pharmacology, Electric Stimulation, In Vitro Techniques, Membranes, drug effects, Mollusca, Muscle Contraction, drug effects, Muscles, physiology, Serotonin, pharmacology, Thiourea, pharmacology, Trypsin, pharmacology
16059001<Distribution of chylomicrons and albumin in dog kidney.<1. Under specified experimental conditions the distribution space of labelled chylomicrons in the kidney was 13.8 +/- 0.9 ml./100 g. tissue. The assumption is supported that this provides a measure for the quantity of intravascular plasma constituents.2. Values for red blood cells and albumin distribution spaces were 5.2 +/- 0.6 and 20.2 +/- 1.0 ml./100 g tissue, respectively, in the whole kidney. The ratio of tissue haematocrit over simultaneous arterial haematocrit averaged 0.56. The extravascular albumin fraction amounted to about 31.0% of the total albumin in the whole kidney.3. A statistically significant correlation was demonstrated between osmotic urine/plasma (U/P) ratios (within the approximate limits of 0.6-1.8) and quantities of extravascular albumin in the medulla.<Animals, Biological Transport, Chromium Isotopes, Chylomicrons, analysis, Dogs, Erythrocytes, analysis, Hematocrit, Iodine Isotopes, Kidney, physiology, Radiometry, Serum Albumin, analysis

16059003<Temperature changes produced by the injection of catecholamines and 5-hydroxytryptamine into the cerebral ventricles of the conscious mouse.<1. Changes in temperature were determined following injection of noradrenaline, adrenaline, isoprenaline, dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) into the cerebral ventricles of the conscious mouse.2. Noradrenaline (1-20 mug) and dopamine (10-160 mug) caused falls in body temperature. Adrenaline (1-20 mug) caused a slight and transient rise in body temperature followed by a fall. Isoprenaline (5-20 mug) caused a rise in body temperature, hypothermia only occurring after very high doses (200 mug) of this catecholamine.3. alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocking agents, phentolamine (&gt; 2 mug) and propranolol (&gt; 5 mug) respectively, caused falls in body temperature when injected into the cerebral ventricles of the mouse.4. Specific drug antagonism studies were limited owing to the intrinsic effects of the alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocking agents. However, some evidence was obtained to indicate that noradrenaline mediated its effects through a central alpha-type adrenergic receptor.5. 5-HT (10-160 mug) caused a fall in body temperature. The action of this indoleamine and the catecholamines in regard to thermoregulatory function is discussed.<Animals, Body Temperature Regulation, drug effects, Cerebral Ventricles, drug effects, Dopamine, pharmacology, Epinephrine, pharmacology, Isoproterenol, pharmacology, Male, Mice, Phentolamine, pharmacology, Propranolol, pharmacology, Serotonin, pharmacology, Sympathetic Nervous System, drug effects, Sympatholytics, pharmacology, Sympathomimetics, pharmacology
16059004<Force: velocity pproperties of kitten muscles.<1. The characteristics of isometric contractions and force:velocity properties of the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and soleus (SOL) muscles of neonatal kittens were determined in situ.2. The mean contraction time is 51 msec for EDL and 70 msec for SOL and the half-relaxation time is 51 msec for EDL and 109 msec for SOL.3. The average maximum isometric tetanic tension per unit cross-sectional area of muscle is 1.27 kg/cm(2) for EDL and 1.17 kg/cm(2) for SOL.4. The average twitch:tetanus ratio is 0.28 for EDL and 0.119 for SOL; the low value for SOL was found for both indirect and direct stimulation.5. The average maximum speed of shortening of a sarcomere is 22.8 mu/sec for EDL and 12.7 mu/sec for SOL.6. These properties of neonatal muscles are compared with those of adult cat muscles and discussed in connexion with differentiation of mammalian muscles into fast and slow types.<Aging, Animals, Animals, Newborn, Cats, Muscle Contraction, physiology, Muscles, physiology, Physiology, Comparative
16059005<Factors influencing contraction and catch in Mytilus smooth muscle.<1. Conditions are defined which determine the level of catch after acetylcholine stimulation of Mytilus muscle.2. Catch tension in dissected muscle is absent when connexions with ganglia are intact.3. Catch tension is absent at temperatures above 30 degrees C.4. Catch tension decreases when intervals between stimuli are increased.5. Increasing concentrations of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) from 10(-8)M to 10(-6)M quantitatively decreases catch tension.6. The length-tension curve of ganglion-free Mytilus muscle bundles suggests that catch tension varies in proportion to the tension developed in contraction.7. External Ca(2+) concentration has no selective influence on catch.8. All factors which reduce catch also increase muscle excitability, suggesting that catch may depend on a mechanism controlling the intracellular concentration of an activator such as Ca(2+).<Acetylcholine, pharmacology, Animals, Calcium, pharmacology, In Vitro Techniques, Mollusca, Muscle Contraction, drug effects, physiology, Muscle, Smooth, physiology, Neuromuscular Junction, physiology, Serotonin, pharmacology, Temperature
16059006<The action of 5-hydroxytryptamine on Mytilus smooth muscle.<1. In the nerve-muscle preparation, where catch was characteristically minimal, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) had no effect on resting membrane potential, junction potentials, spikes or contraction.2. In muscle bundles, where catch was prominent, 5-HT did not change membrane potentials, but prolonged junction potentials and lowered the threshold for spike discharge and contraction.3. In muscle bundles, exposed to high concentrations of 5-HT, depolarization evoked repetitive spikes, while in low 5-HT, spikes were seldom fired even with much greater depolarization.4. In muscle bundles, the effective membrane resistance, R(eff.), decreased from 45-60 to 23-35 MOmega as 5-HT concentration was increased.5. It is suggested that 5-HT may facilitate spike discharge by lowering the internal free Ca(2+) concentration.<Animals, Calcium, pharmacology, In Vitro Techniques, Membrane Potentials, drug effects, Mollusca, Muscle Contraction, drug effects, Muscle, Smooth, drug effects, Neuromuscular Junction, drug effects, Serotonin, pharmacology
16059649<Fallout from the Chinese nuclear explosion of 17 June 1967.<Low-level activities of iodine-131, barium-140, and strontium-89 were found in a series of rain samples collected at Fayetteville, Arkansas, during the period from late June through August 1967. The ratios of these short-lived isotopes to strontium-90 were determined as accurately as possible. The data indicate that the debris from the Chinese nuclear explosion was injected primarily into the stratosphere.<Arkansas, Barium, analysis, Iodine Isotopes, analysis, Radiation Monitoring, Radioactive Fallout, Radioisotopes, Strontium Isotopes, analysis
16059650<Nucleotide sequence of KB cell 5S RNA.<The nucleotide sequence of 5S RNA derived from KB carcinoma cell ribosomes has been determined. The molecule has a length of either 120 or 121 nucleotides with uridine at its 3'-terminus and guanylic acid at its 5'-terminus. If, in addition to Watson-Crick base-pairing, one accepts occasional base-pairing of guanylic acid to uridylic acid, long sequences of complementary nucleotides can be identified within the molecule. Two regions of the molecule contain sequences complementary to four or five bases in the pentanucleotide sequence guanylic acid, ribothymidylic acid, pseudouridylic acid, cytidylic acid, guanylic acid, which is common to most transfer RNA molecules. This is the first time the sequence of an animal-cell RNA has been determined.<Autoradiography, Carcinoma, Squamous Cell, Culture Techniques, Electrophoresis, Humans, Nucleotides, analysis, Phosphorus Isotopes, RNA, analysis, Ribonucleases, metabolism
16059651<Photoreactivation in vivo of pyrimidine dimers in paramecium DNA.<Cells of Paramecium aurelia labeled with tritiated thymidine were irradiated with ultraviolet light and then were either exposed to photoreactivating light or kept in the dark as controls. In the controls, the level of thymine-containing pyrimidine dimers did not change, but in cells exposed to photoreactivating light such dimers were destroyed. This is the first demonstration in a eukaryote of in vivo photoreactivation of thymine-containing pyrimidine dimers.<Animals, Chromatography, Paper, DNA, radiation effects, Paramecium, radiation effects, Pyrimidines, analysis, Radiation Genetics, Thymidine, metabolism, Thymine, analysis, Tritium, Ultraviolet Rays
16059652<Action potentials without contraction in frog skeletal muscle fibers with disrupted transverse tubules.<Action potentials, with no accompanying contraction, were recorded from muscle fibers in which the transverse tubular system had been disrupted. The results show that action potentials require an intact transverse tubular system to cause contraction. Furthermore, both the after-depolarization following a single action potential and the slower, late afterpotential following a train of action potentials were absent in this preparation. Therefore, both phenomena must normally involve the transverse tubular system.<Action Potentials, Animals, Anura, Glycerol, pharmacology, Membrane Potentials, Muscle Contraction, physiology, Myofibrils, anatomy &amp; histology
16059653<Haptoglobin levels in serum of various strains of mice.<Only a single type of haptoglobin was found in the serum of 11 strains of mice, but there were wide variations between strains with respect to the amount of haptoglobin found. In the AKR and C3H strains, in which haptoglobin was low or absent, various agents stimulated production of high levels of haptoglobin. Serum haptoglobin rose in association with the development of leukemia in AKR mice, but remained low when C3H mice developed mammary tumors.<Animals, Blood Protein Electrophoresis, Breeding, Haptoglobins, blood, Injections, Subcutaneous, Leukemia, blood, Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental, blood, Mice, Turpentine, pharmacology
